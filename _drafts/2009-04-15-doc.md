"copy" a product for local consumption.


And certainly as one who tries to be somewhat of a locavore, I can appreciate that
there are many reasons to want to produce products similar to those we find
around the world here at home.

A few things to take note of - largely, we're talking about luxury foods - wines,
cheeses, liquors, and so on.  Very few people are concerned about the benefits of
US-produced soya products versus Brazilian soy. We'll get back to that later.

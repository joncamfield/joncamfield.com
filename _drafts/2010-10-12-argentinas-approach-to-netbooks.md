While in Argentina, I took some time to learn about the Conectar Igualidad project, which is an outsized offshoot of Argentina's early work with OLPC back in 2006 as one of the first ministries to announce a partnership http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/countries/four_countries_commi.html . 

It's important to note that I am not talking about the 60,000 OLPC project in La Rioja, working with elementary schools, which we've covered here before: http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/argentina/olpc_argentina_starts_in_la_ri.html	http://www.olpcnews.com/countries/argentina/argentinas_president_kirchner_hands_out_the_first_xos_in_la_rioja.html.  That is all well and good, but, the Conecta Igualidad is a multi-year project, with hundreds of thousands of laptops already in the field through the earlier Inclusion Digital project, which provided netbooks to technical school students.

The program combines a 1:1 computing model with a strong emphasis on supporting the entire ecosystem - the teachers and school infrastructure as well as the parents of the students.  This means intensive teacher training, an entire teacher portal of information on the web () and archived on the laptops proivided to the teachers.  This means tools on the laptop to engage parents, both to support the education of their children and for their own self-improvment.  This means full political buy-in and dedication to the program.  It also means the people implementing the program work closely with their neighbors in Brazil and Uruguay, sharing best practices and warnings.

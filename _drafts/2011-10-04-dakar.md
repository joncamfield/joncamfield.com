<h3>Beyond Drupal Hacking</h3>

<table style="width:auto; float: right"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/x9hze08wNoUD3Tyy09X6t4xTTBa8__GOmRmIhgJU4h4?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h-cPV9bEuqo/ToiYVdh1ISI/AAAAAAAADds/VqsCgVJ5T7c/s144/IMG_6629.JPG" height="108" width="144" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/joncamfield/Dakar?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCOGEgYy1oY-YBw&feat=embedwebsite">Dakar</a></td></tr></table> I also was able to hang out with our one of the amazing <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/">Changemakers</a> Community Mobilizers -- even though our planned excursion to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gor%C3%A9e">Goree Island</a> was overruled by the weather, we caught up over lunch at an amazing French restaurant downtown (Le Galette) while waiting out the storm.

Through a random series of connections, I caught up with the CIO of TechSoup Global, who's taken a year sabbatical and moved his family to Dakar for what will I'm sure be the experience of a lifetime for them all. When I first was exploring Dakar for professional development, I'd contacted a returned Peace Corps volunteer who had done a great job at getting her small school in a rural area outside of Dakar online, and this same school had an immense installation of OLPC laptops.  I have a longstanding interest in OLPC deployments (indeed, I got slashdotted for suggesting that we take off our rose-colored glasses when looking at OLPC).  This quickly led to a rapid email exchange among the volunteer, and her support contact in San Fran, who makes long-distance solar-powered wifi links (green-wifi.org) and partners with Inveneo.  This opened another door into a microcommunity of San Fran technologists - one of whom being Manning Sutton, the Tech Soup Global CIO.  We had lunch at the Institut Frances, which is a total expat/foreign service haven in the middle of downtown, and while I try to avoid such places, they are comforting at times.  The conversation extends over beers and a stroll around downtown, and covers the infrastructural challenges, technology and social change, and the boneheadedness of the computer industry in totaly missing a vast market for quality computers that are energy efficient, and could last longer on backup power. If TechSoup institutes a professional development budget like Changemakers, by the way, I get the credit.  He was blown away by the value of it, especially for the tech geeks inside TSG who sometimes feel they are too disconnected from the on-the-ground experience that nonprofits are facing.  A good chunk of this conversation repeats itself at dinner with Tidiane, as we commiserate over the increasing frequency of the power outages and how it impacts his ability to not only deliver his news in a timely fashion, but growing his business with a journalism training course and similar.

I eventually made it out to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gor%C3%A9e">Ile Goree</a>, which promotes itself a bit more than history supports as a transshipment point for the slave trade, but regardless it was a pleasant change of pace from downtown Dakar.  <table style="width:auto; float: right"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/7QXbgvIZmWzHIALq4Kr_24xTTBa8__GOmRmIhgJU4h4?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-F9q4WhmrwjE/ToiYY_m9K-I/AAAAAAAADd4/bOZSh5LcXEE/s144/IMG_6642.JPG" height="108" width="144" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/joncamfield/Dakar?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCOGEgYy1oY-YBw&feat=embedwebsite">Dakar</a></td></tr></table> <table style="width:auto;"><tr><td><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Hnc0Oqw3xFM-I5YJflHU6IxTTBa8__GOmRmIhgJU4h4?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-o8yTlTkrt8Q/ToiaEfF1TMI/AAAAAAAADjM/NEyXW2Ci9nQ/s144/IMG_6748.JPG" height="108" width="144" /></a></td></tr><tr><td style="font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:11px; text-align:right">From <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/joncamfield/Dakar?authuser=0&authkey=Gv1sRgCOGEgYy1oY-YBw&feat=embedwebsite">Dakar</a></td></tr></table>

There was so much in the trip - late night conversations on the value of independent journalism over mint tea with Tidiane, wrestling with power outages, long discussions with the Ouestaf staff, exploring the odd parts of Dakar, markets and capitalism gone amok, frustrations, random neighborhood drum circles, reminders of the annoyances of licenses and other software restrictions when there are so many other challenges to deal with, musings on Drupal 7  -- but this post is already getting long.  Come by and chat for more stories and a goat sound recording.

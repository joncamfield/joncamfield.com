  	      "low lift" is not a 3 day process to make a loaf of bread, my peeps. Low lift is 5 minutes of dumping things into a bread machine and pressing a button. Which I did and now have a nice tasty loaf that's giving the sourdough starter next to it on the counter some serious side eye.

  	      (Yes I'm over here dunking on sourdough because it's the least worst problem in the world; I'm not sure I can handle the rest from even just this week.)

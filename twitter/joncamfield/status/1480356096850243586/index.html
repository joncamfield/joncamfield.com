  	      I'm feeling very Gen-Y here, but there was a web 2.0 that was built with vast interoperability and open standards.  It was a creator's paradise. It included social media, but was not limited to walled-garden social media sites.

  	      Like, I had automations that pushed my blog updates to twitter, which then auto-posted also to facebook. Thanks to that, I actually was significantly more… social on social media.  I even had just one chat app that worked with both gchat and fb messenger (and more!).

  	      It was wonderful, but then a lot of growing companies locked their systems down (google, facebook - mainly looking at you).  Then google axed Google Reader, vastly cutting the adoption and use of RSS, and it all just kinda dried up?

  	      Sure, some of us curmudgeons still write blogs and publish RSS feeds, but the vibrancy of the interoperable Internet is gone.

  	      Moxie's web3 piece (<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html</a>) hits all the specifics that bother me -- it is a reshuffling of tech, but incentives towards centralized models have already shown through and are being problematic, and it's only at the beginning of its buzz cycle.

  	      I desperately want to see a more re-decentralized web. I actually think improved usability, equity, and functionality could let people run their own servers in a possible future (I wrote about the benefits and the numerous challenges here: <a href="https://joncamfield.com/blog/2021.05/centering-decentralization">https://joncamfield.com/blog/2021.05/centering-decentralization</a>)

  	      FRIENDS. To intro my part of @draganakaurin 's epic @RightsCon panel (<a href="https://sched.co/PvjZ">https://sched.co/PvjZ</a>); we came up with the idea to have a cheesy-bad memorial video/slide tribute to innovative, even great, technologies that were over hyped.

  	      @draganakaurin @rightscon I am asking for your contributions here - everything from 8-track tapes to betamax to "Project Ginger" (Segways) to the OLPC, what should we include? What other silver bullets just didn't work out? Bonus points for historic fails.

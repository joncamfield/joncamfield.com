  	      This is *definitely* not my parents’ cat… But the cat is likely of the opinion that it has trained my parents to be acceptable humans. <div class="gallery"><ul><li><a href="../../tweets_media/1411485774646759424-E5aa1DkXEAcG7Nf.jpg"><img src="../../tweets_media/1411485774646759424-E5aa1DkXEAcG7Nf.jpg"></a></li></ul></div>

  	      Update: they have captured this cat, spayed her, and accumulated multiple vet bills. But as my parents insist, they do not have a cat.

<br/><b>Updates!</b><br/>
<li>Friday, 4/30, IT IS FINISHED!!!!!!!!!!
<li>Monday, 4/26, I sent it in to Abel's for Binding!!
<li>Wednesday, 4/21, It's just ALMOST done, folks.  I'm taking it to the
printers this or early next week!

<li>Saturday, 4/3, <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Lost+Highway+(1997)"
target="newwindow">"Dick Laurent is dead"</a>.  Er, that is, the last
chapter is written out.  Still remaining is revising almost everything,
writing the conclusion and constructing the appendices, but I'm on the
last stretch, and it feels good.
<li>Saturday, 3/27 was the thesis symposium.  I presented my thesis at the
Thompson Conference Center, and it was received well by the audience.  My
thesis supervisor commented to me later that I am "clearly on top of the
material".  Ah, gotta love these ego-strokes.
<li>Friday, 3/19, Finished writing out Part II, Chapter 2, decided to drop
the last chapter--only two chapters left to write!! (We're down to 25
pages to go here, folks!)
<li>Thursday, 3/18, Got the work back from my second reader.  She had this
to say:
<blockquote>Jon--This is great! I'm looking forward to getting the final
draft so I can quote you like mad in my book.</blockquote>
<li>Thursday, 3/4, I dropped
off a 40 page beast of my introduction
and first 2 chapters.  Only 6 more chapters to go! (*shudder*)

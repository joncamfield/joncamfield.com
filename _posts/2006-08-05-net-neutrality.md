<p>I've mostly avoided wading in on the Net Neutrality debate; not because I don't feel strongly about it, but because it seems so blatantly wrong that I feel arguing for it is like arguing for the importance of sunshine or eating every day.  Further, I'm not too overly concerned about the consequences of "losing" this fight -- sure, I don't want to, but I figure a few days after ISPs start implementing annoying bandwidth restrictions, the geek type users will start implementing labyinthine methods to work around it.  Can we say http over voip tunnelling, boys and girls?</p>

excerpt: "When I asked the <a href=\"https://aus.gingermanpub.com/\">Ginger Man</a>
  if they could host a crazy crowd of ICT4D and mobile4dev geeks rolling in to network
  and share stories from the frontlines of technology and development, they replied
  simply, \"bring it.\"\r\n\r\nI forward that sentiment on to you.  If you hack, build,
  or implement tools all the way from water pumps to LED lanterns to OLPCs to citizen
  journalism software, bring your best toy, story, or idea for how technology can
  support global development, promote equality, and topple authoritarian regimes.\r\n\r\nRSVP
  here, but attendance will be governed by the space we have available: https://ict4dev.eventbrite.com/\r\n\r\nBonus:
  Learn about the upcoming Ashoka/Changemakers collaborative competition on building
  sustainable models supporting access, freedom of speech, information quality and
  privacy!  You can read the background <a href=\"https://knowledge.ashoka.org/node/4983\">on
  our googly adventure</a>.\r\n\r\nMonday, March 12 starting at 5pm at The Ginger
  Man (301 Lavaca)"

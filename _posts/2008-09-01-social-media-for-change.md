excerpt: <p>Ning, if you haven't heard of it, is a roll-your-own "web 2.0" platform,
  where you can combine blogs, videos, forums, and so on in seconds in a web interface.  It's
  like a constrained, but amazingly easy to use social content management system.  What's
  better is that it has impressive open-source hooks in, if you want to go down that
  route, you can access and build upon your site's code and data structure.  It's
  free for it's basic <em>my community name . ning.com</em>, and beyond that you start
  paying fees for custom names and services.</p>

<p>There's some great ning sites - I like <a href="http://ourworldcommunity.ning.com/">The Our World Community</a> which focuses on sustainable business for example.  This past week has brought together a vibrant community for a different cause - Hurricane information sharing and volunteer work at <a href="http://gustav08.ning.com/">http://gustav08.ning.com/</a>, the brainchild of <a href="http://www.andycarvin.com/archives/2008/08/getting_involved_in_gustav.html">Andy Carvin</a>, and it's sister site <a href="http://www.gustavwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">http://www.gustavwiki.com/</a>.</p>

<p>These efforts also underline powerful roles for online volunteers - people unable to travel but still interested in helping out in meaningful ways, which is fantastic.</p>

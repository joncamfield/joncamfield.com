<p>So, between getting back from Peace Corps and coming to DC for grad school, I lived in a rather unique <a href="http://synapthein.info/dashaus">house</a>, which fuels stories from cross-border under-the-wire monetary transactions using Final Fantasy XII codes, to City Council politics and communal living.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Cohen">Bram Cohen</a> stayed there (he and my roommate were good friends from the p2p scene) during SXSW-05 (So, when I joke about having a third of the Internet traffic in my living room at one point, I'm <a href="http://in.tech.yahoo.com/041103/137/2ho4i.html">only partially kidding</a>.</p>

<p>Anyhow.  That's a very longwinded way to plug this former roommate's current project, which can be thought about as streaming bittorrent-like downloading for video.  That's a gross simplification I'm sure (he once showed me a three-dimensional model of his p2p networking algorithm, my brain has yet to quite recover):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.actlab.tv/">ActLab TV</a>, a project of the Foundation for Decentralization Research, is hosting their <a href="http://blanu.livejournal.com/21570.html">Launch Party</a> (if you're lucky enough to be in Austin) and a <a href="http://www.actlab.tv/utr_festival.html">Video Festival</a> for the rest of us to watch online through their snazzy technology.</p>

<p>The cool part of this technology is that is can potentially put video broadcasting on a level where amateurs can successfully create and distribute content without killing their bandwidth.  This has important consequences for NGOs and non-profits interested in making video documentary (of human rights abuses, labor law violations, etc) widely available.  The same technology could be used at a demonstration to record and broadcase the event live using a high-speed cell-phone connection or a wifi mesh network with someone on it providing and uplink -- which means that the videographer could be arrested and his/her gear confiscated -- but the video would already be in distribution and potentially cached remotely.</p>

<p>Of course, it's still a beta technology, and even at full production power, it would require some technological know-how to implement, but at least it provides a distribution channel.</p>

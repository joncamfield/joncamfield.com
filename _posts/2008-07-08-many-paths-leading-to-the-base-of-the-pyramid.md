<p>Edwards makes the strong argument that</p>

"The philanthrocapitalists love handing out new prizes-for building private spaceships and electric cars, sequencing the human genome, and ending global warming-but not for the [Swan Lake Fire Department] Ladies Auxiliary or reviving New Orleans."

<p>The NextBillion writers respond to his basic point - market solutions only address a limited scope of attractive projects:</p>

For example, a market-oriented development model might address the issue of rural access to energy by promoting an enterprise that sells low cost solar panels.  A more traditional civil society organization might work to build a grassroots network of groups that call governments out for favoring urban over rural populations in the distribution of public resources.

<p>Naturally both Edwards' favored civil society, as well as social entrepreneurship, are both tethered to traditional development models through grants and policies, so neither is wholly ground-breaking.</p>

<p>Edwards notes that "There is no place for triumphalism in this conversation." - I think that can go deeper; there is no place for triumphalism in development approaches.  In some cases, governments and educational ministries/departments will be the best able to address a problem, sometimes civil society, communities, and NGOs, and sometimes the marketplace itself.  One of the long-standing problems I've had with traditional development models is the one-size-fits-all approach it is prone to.  Combine that approach with <a href="http://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2007/12/whos_to_blame_for_a_bad_loan.html">lenders without accountability for bad loans</a>, and you have a collection of projects; some good, some disastrous failures, but all being pursued in a one-minded way.  Perhaps big infrastructure projects should sometimes be government-funded, but sometimes perhaps <a href="http://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2008/07/post_3.html">the private sector can also help</a> (and provide long-term sustainability to boot!)  Sometimes local NGOs are the only way to achieve long-term change from the bottom up.  There's a place - a potentially large and powerful place - for the private sector to address, help, and still profit from the base of the pyramid.  That doesn't mean that all development work should, or even can be private-sector led.</p>

<p>There's a lot to change globally to create a better world, and we should work on providing an inclusive model to work with and support anyone who thinks they can lend a hand instead of fighting turf wars for the dominance of any one approach.</p>

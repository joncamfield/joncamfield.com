<p>Installing xo activities is a snap, up there with OSX's .dmg install process.  Installing anything else can be a bit of a pain, as it's command line installation using RedHat's yum system (which at least has fixed dependency checking since last I used it (I started with RH5.2, then left Linux, then got back into it with Debian and have been a Debian/ubuntu user mostly ever since).</p>

<p>The black and white screen mode is amazing.  End of story.  The screen-rotating button is nice when switching to ebook/tablet mode, though the lack of access to the touchpad in ebook mode can be awkward.</p>

<p>Wifi config is annoying to me, but obviously designed for the expected default use case of meshing with other XOs and a school server, not hopping on an open wifi access-point network.</p>

<p>Every laptop should have a built-in handle, or at least some way to attach one.</p>

<p>The keyboard is still a bitch to use.  It's back at hunt and peck speed almost, and I keep not hitting the space bar right, and sometimes it feels like you really have to mash down on the keys - but precisely - to type.  I'm sure I'll get the hang of most of it, but my hands are just too big to use the control keys (shift/ctrl/alt/fn) the way I'm used to.  Also, the hold-down-key-repeat "feature" seems missing - perhaps by design.</p>

<p>My battery life seems to be around 3 hours with some activity, and doesn't ever hit 100% charge (as soon as I unplug it it's at 97%). Hopefully the update coming out next week will enable sleep and hibernation, which should improve that dramatically.</p>

<p>Overall, impressive, but despite the fact that it's already being rolled out, it's still rough around the edges.</p>

<p>This post typed and posted via OLPC/XO -- blame the keyboard for typoes.</p>

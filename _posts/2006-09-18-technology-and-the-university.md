<p>More tangentially related tech info, my former employers, The University of Texas' <a href="https://www.otc.utexas.edu/">Office of Technology Commercialization</a> are hosting their next big conference to feature commercializable UT research.  Last years had tech ranging from backpack-totatble HIV/AIDS field testing units to creepily-good evolutionarily-learning AI .  This year they're also including some fascinating talks on technology creation and diffusion in the University/government/private enterprise triangle, and a panel discussion on Open Source, including an appearance by Google's OSS maven, Chris DiBona. <a href="https://www.otc.utexas.edu/Events/Oct2006/index.jsp">Check it out</a>!</p>

MB: The plan is still to ship units in large quantities by the end of the first quarter of 2007 -- that hasn't changed in quite a long time. As of now the countries we are going to ship the laptop to will probably be Thailand, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina, and Egypt. The other two big countries we would like to launch at -- India and China -- are not as clear yet.

<p>I really object to the language "launch at" - is this a development program, or a marketing campaign (or, for that matter, a military campaign)?</p>

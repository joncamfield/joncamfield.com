So, via <a href="https://twitter.com/runasand">@runasand</a>, I learn that Buzzfeed's writers have PGP keys:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I hear all <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzFeed">@BuzzFeed</a> journalists have the ability to send encrypted emails. Wonder when we&#39;ll see this in other newsrooms.</p>&mdash; Runa A. Sandvik (@runasand) <a href="https://twitter.com/runasand/status/643804486461456384">September 15, 2015</a></blockquote>

I cannot express in mere words how much this makes me happy in the world of normalizing real people having the ability to send actually secure email (especially to journalists!).  PGP's various implementations get a lot of heat for their lack of usability, and the process itself, even with a theoretically super-easy interface, is still a complex set of ideas to understand and use in your normal communications.  So every organization I see that is willing to tackle this head-on, and (hopefully!) have internal champions, mentors, support, training, and drinking games (I presume) to really encourage adoption is a huge win, be that a 3 person organization or a 100-person organization.

Still, I can't help myself:

"All of Buzzfeed's PGP Keys -- you won't believe the last one!" (Sorry, I cannot help myself) https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=%40buzzfeed.com&op=index

"Buzzfeed journalists can send encrypted emails -- but why they send them will blow your mind!"

"Top 10 passwords buzzfeed journalists use for PGP -- #8 will drive you crazy!"

"3 pieces of metadata not protected by encrypted emails you'd never guess!"

"5 attachments you never thought you'd be able to send encrypted to buzzfeed!"

The <a href="http://technologysalon.org/">Technology Salon</a> on SMS4D covered a lot of ground in a few hours, but the reverberating sentiment was the power of mobile technology at the local/regional level.  Part of this is a bit of sour-grapes with the hard challenges of scaling mobile solutions globally, which is as much a problem of cross-provider functionality as it is capacity.  The value however is in reminding us that development solutions - while they may be globally replicable - are rooted locally. 

The Technology Salon went through an inspiring round of implementations and use cases of on-the-ground efforts using texts in cross-sector development situations.  Microfinance solutions, tying the payments to the notifications via mpayment were the purview of <a href="http://www.creditsms.org">CreditSMS</a>, lowering the costs of each loan by dramatically reducing transactional costs, allowing MFI account managers to deal with the exceptions (late/missedpayments) instead of burning time tracking payments to records and managing each interaction.  mHealth, a <a href="http://wayan.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=13&tag=mHealth&limit=20">favorite topic of Tech Salons</a> had use cases in using SMS to replace timely and costly travel to report medicine stock levels and local disease trends, but also mobile-centric medical records management and remote, low-cost diagnostics tools, all using <a  href="http://medic.frontlinesms.com/product-tour/">SMS:Medic</a>.  

<a href="http://ow.ly/17pJoY">OpenGov</a> is another example of a sector with clear needs for interactivity and data-gathering, enabling 311 style systems via SMS to go through a tree of interactive SMSes to report problems or get information (Anything from reporting a pothole to figuring out what pest is destroying your crops).  Local government could also datamine this to track local trends and spot emerging problems.  Even mobile-enhanced education was discussed, a popular topic at <a  href="http://edutechdebate.org/">EduTechDebate</a>, but presented in a very realistic framing at the Salon as an assistance technology to existing educational programs.

The data coming out of tools like these also can bubble up into knowledge products -- a dashboard of geo-tagged symptoms linked to key infectious diseases would be invaluable at spotting outbreaks and managing stock levels, targetted outreach/intervention, or other responses.  Local governments could see dashboards on complaints about various services and expose systemic problems - handily also increasing their likelihood at getting re-elected.

As with politics, all change is local.  The reverberating message from the salon was to have your technology where the decision-makers are.  If you want local, on-the-ground reaction to a text message, then the actor and the technology need to be on the ground.  

Cloud-based, Internet-only apps have their place, but the beauty of text messaging is that it operates off-grid, and the only real solutions are those which can follow mobile devices to places without electricity and Internet connectivity.

<blockquote>Code-named “Morro,” this streamlined solution will be available in the second half of 2009 and will provide comprehensive protection from malware including viruses, spyware, rootkits and trojans. This new solution, to be offered at no charge to consumers, will be architected for a smaller footprint that will use fewer computing resources, making it ideal for low-bandwidth scenarios or less powerful PCs. As part of Microsoft’s move to focus on this simplified offering, the company also announced today that it will discontinue retail sales of its Windows Live OneCare subscription service effective June 30, 2009.</blockquote>

<p>“Customers around the world have told us that they need comprehensive, ongoing protection from new and existing threats, and we take that concern seriously,” said Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft. “This new, no-cost offering will give us the ability to protect an even greater number of consumers, especially in markets where the growth of new PC purchases is outpaced only by the growth of malware.” </p>

<p>This is something they simply had to do or risk losing emerging markets to Linux-based systems.  It will be interesting to see how this affects the anti-virus market in general, and the big (and expensive) players specifically -- will they come out with low-cost or "free" versions, work on a developing-world-only edition?  Work closer with OEMs and institutions to buy large license blocks (i.e. work with Ministries of education to supply a blanket license to all their systems)?</p>

<p>As an advocate of open source for development, it saddens me that this barrier has been removed (technically, will be - it could be vaporware still) -- but having seen the disastrous landscape of unprotected systems in the developing world, I am hopeful that this will reduce the impact that malware has on existing Windows systems.</p>

excerpt: "There's been a lot of noise about the role of Twitter in the recent Moldova
  protests.  Ethan Zuckerman took it on himself to <a href=\"https://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2009/04/13/studying-twitter-and-the-moldovan-protests/\">quantify
  the data</a>.  It's not as glamorous as blindly claiming that twitter did (or did
  not) ignite the protests based on some stories, but it does provide a good sanity-check:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>My
  bitter, cynical hope had been to demonstrate that the conversation switched from
  a small Romanian-language conversation about the actual protest events to a self-congratulation
  festival in the English-language twittersphere. Good thing we’ve got data to prove
  me wrong. [...] I’d expected to see “twitter” emerge as one of the most popular
  terms by Wednesday or Thursday, and to see the conversation shift into English.
  [...] But by Thursday, Twitter’s out of the top 20 entirely and “comunistii” ranks
  behind Moldova and Chisinau. So yes, the conversation on Wednesday - the busiest
  day with over 1,000 authors - included lots of non-Moldovans. But the conversation
  quickly shifted back to the political standoff.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat being said,
  there are under 200 reported actual twitter users inside Moldova; so while the conversation
  avoided turning into the twitter version of back-patting, it also is not the twitter
  flash-mob we're looking for.  \r\n\r\nWorse, governments are getting more sophisticated
  in limiting the utility of mobile phones for this kind of disruption, as <a href=\"https://neteffect.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/04/07/moldovas_twitter_revolution\">Evgeny
  Morozov at ForeignPolicy</a> reminds us:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I've just spoken to
  a Moldovan friend who is himself a big technology fan; according to him, there is
  little to none cellphone coverage in the square itself (turning off cellphone coverage
  in protest areas is a trick that was also used by the Belarusian authorities to
  diffuse 2006 protests in Minsk's central square), so protesters have to leave it
  to post updates to Twitter via GPRS technology on their mobiles.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIt
  seems likely that next time around, the government will also make sure GPRS is hobbled
  as well, and there were reports that the government was strong-arming local ISPs
  into restricting outside connections.\r\n\r\nSo while Twitter was involved, it seems
  too early to claim it's victory, as both Evgeny Morozov and Ethan Zuckerman seem
  to agree on. There was no sign-in form at the protest with a \"Where did you hear
  about this? ( ) Twitter ( ) Facebook  ( ) SMS (non-twitter)  ( ) Friend  ... \"
  so we can't really be sure of the impact of any one social utility over another
  (though we could do some interesting things with Facebook photo tagging perhaps?),
  and this will continue to haunt any attempts to link online social media movements
  with offline action.\r\n\r\nThat's not the only story here, though.  While I'm excited
  about turning online interaction into offline action, I strongly believe that the
  lower-hanging fruit in social media sites is real-time, mass reporting of events.
  \ You may get a thousand different viewpoints, but you're guaranteed to not just
  get one filtered and sanitized report.  As Evgeny Morozov notes;\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There
  are also a few moving English-language Twitter posts like this - \"in #pman  a grenade
  thrown by the police has torn apart one of the protester's leg\"-  that would surely
  be perused by foreign journalists. </blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe saw the role of SMS and
  Twitter in getting the news out about the <a href=\"https://joncamfield.com/blog/2008.11/whats-happening-in-mumbai-twit.html\">Mumbai
  bombings</a> in November 2008.  As microblogging sites get increasingly sophisticated
  (or their users settle on hashtags and location update formats) I think we can expect
  to see fast local news coming not from traditional media but from our peers.  Without
  editorial oversight or research/verification, we'll have to rely on mass numbers
  of twitterers reporting on each event to present an evenhanded view, but overall
  I see this move towards instant sharing of information as an amazing development
  that will only getbetter and more interesting, both in the case of free speech and
  media, and for <a href=\"https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.04/whats-next.html\">mobile
  possibilities for development</a>.\r\n"

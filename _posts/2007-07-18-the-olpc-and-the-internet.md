<p>The bitfrost <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.laptop.org/git.do?p=security;a=blob;hb=HEAD;f=bitfrost.txt">specification</a> indicates that perhaps some countries may not believe that the unique   green branding will protect the laptop from theft:  971 The OLPC project has received very strong requests from certain countries<br />972 considering joining the program to provide a powerful anti-theft service that<br />973 would act as a theft deterrent against most thieves.<br />
Bitfrost meets this challenge, but not without cost.  With bitfrost, we see a return to a requirement for Internet connectivity to ensure the laptop's non-stolen status, or the laptop effectively "bricks" and won't work without going through a re-activation process.</p>

<p>This Internet requirement is mentioned briefly in the <a href="https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,72669-0.html?tw=wn_culture_1" target="_blank">Wired article</a>.</p>

<p>Now, this at first glance seems a bit at odds with the OLPC Wiki's section discussing school gateway servers:The OLPC networking concept is not Internet-based. We assume that there will be no Internet connectivity and no Internet gateways. The laptops are being deployed into countries which do not have a lot of native-language content available on the Internet.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there's more:In the case of an area without internet connectivity, a local school can extend the lease from its own server by Wi-Fi or with a USB dongle."</p>

<p>The specification goes into much more detail about how both activation (see line 318 and forward) and the USB dongle system works (see line 1009 and forward).</p>

<p>Of course, if the stolen laptop is taken from one community to another without Internet, then presumably it'll keep working, until that community's school server is updated (via sneakernet?) with a list of stolen laptops.  Now, there's a word for taking advantage of a market where goods have different values in different locations, it's called <a href="https://www.olpcnews.com/people/negroponte/ebay_olpc_sales_inev.html">arbitrage</a>, and has been going on throughout human history. </p>

<p>Reinstalling the OS would be another route around this, but this, as well as toggling the security system itself, require a developer's key, and hopefully those won't leak out anytime soon.  Another risk of course is if a country discontinues their OLPC project, and no service is available to renew the laptop lease, which has some people on the <a href="https://wiki.laptop.org/go/Talk:Bitfrost" target="_blank">bitfrost discussion page calling it DRM</a> - it is reminiscent of <a href="https://news.com.com/2100-1040-227194.html" target="_blank">Circuit City's DIVX disk phase-out problem</a>...</p>

<p>One would hope that countries wanting to activate the bitfrost system would be willing to put in place the infrastructure it requires - at least Internet connectivity will be fun!</p>

<p>I presented and later ran a roundtable discussion on using web 2.0 and open source software for service/volunteer organizations.  I kept getting requests for a "dummies guide" introduction to what's out there, and I'm going to just start here in my blog and see where that goes.  Two caveats -- I don't believe in "dummies" guides, as I don't really believe in dummies (current White House residents excepted).  Second, the landscape is more like a weather system, not a static landscape that can be described; so I'm going to be more like an almanac, trying to give you some general guidance rather than specific directions.</p>

<p>Let's start out with some basic underlying terms and theory from economics:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effects">Network Effects</a> describe situations where the number of people involved exponentially increases the value of getting involved - for example, if you're the only person with a phone, it's pretty useless, but each additional person who joins the phone network has a multiplicative effect on the number of connections available.  By the same token, if you're the last chump still using a social network that's fallen out of favor (Friendster, Orkut, looking your way), it's equally useless.  You can read lots more about the power of network effects by reading Watt's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Six-Degrees-Science-Connected-Age/dp/0393041425">Six Degrees</a>, and more on all of the stuff I'm about to talk about by checking out Benkler's <a href="http://www.benkler.org/wealth_of_networks/index.php/Main_Page">The Wealth of Networks</a>, which is available for free online as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Networks-Production-Transforms-Markets/dp/0300110561">on Amazon</a>, and you can of course contribute to the ongoing discussion at Benkler's wiki, linked above.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalrous">Rival goods</a> are goods whose consumption by one consumer prevents simultaneous consumption by other consumers -- If I'm sitting in a chair, you can't sit in it, but if I'm reading a website, you can also read it at the same time.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excludability">Excludability</a> is whether or not it is possible to exclude people who have not paid for a good or service from consuming it.  Lighthouses are the traditional example of a non-excludable good; everyone can benefit from a lighthouse's warning.  Excludable goods include anything you can protect or fence off.</p>

<p>Finally, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_costs">Transaction Costs</a> measure how hard it is to do something else; time, research, transport, etc. -- the costs of doing something beyond the cost of that thing itself.</p>

<p>By mixing these together, you can move from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a> to an evolving and increasing self-sustaining ecosystem.</p>

<br clear="all">Tux, the Linux MascotWhat this means back in the world of web 2.0 solutions; we see the power of Facebook to support non-profits in their "causes" application - in under five minutes you can start donating funds to any 501c3 by setting up a cause for it -- that's low transaction costs at work; instead of a laborious set of forms and credit card merchant accounts to set up, it's all automated and easy to connect together.  With Wikipedia, you see the benefits of non-rival, non-excludable goods combined with low transactions costs; it's easy for anyone to edit, the edits add to build a larger system of the encyclopedia, a resource that can't be restricted or reduced by usage.  Indeed, with wikipedia, increased usage creates improved fact-checking and encourages further additions -- something that has gotten termed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-rival_goods">anti-rivalrous goods</a>.

<p>So go and ponder the balancing act between rivalrous non-rivalrous, and anti-rivalrous goods, the impact of excludability and its limiting factors on the spread of information (your cause, your vision, and so on).  A complicating factor here is how open and free can your organization be - are you willing to let people comment on your blog entries?  Edit a wiki resource you're providing (lesson plans, resource guides...)?  Write blogs, uncensored, on your website?  You don't have to go all-in, but the quickest way to kill a web 2.0 strategy is to strangle it by increasing the transaction costs of it; moderating comments, slowing and impeding the natural tendencies of your constituents to work with you to improve your products to the benefit of your organization, and their fellow constituents.</p>

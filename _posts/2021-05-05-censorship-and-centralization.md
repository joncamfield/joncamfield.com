**De-platforming gets thrown around as equivalent to censorship or getting kicked off of the Internet, but this is a dangerous and self-fulfilling lie. Beyond being demonstrably not true, we also cannot cede the digital public square to private corporations which do not, at their core, serve the public interest.**

*This is the "intro" post to a series on the past, present, and future of the Internet, specifically around communities, centralized platforms, and censorship -- and some paths forward.*

* In **"[I Believe in the Internet](https://joncamfield.com/blog/2021.03/i-still-believe-in-the-internet.html)"**, I discuss what life was like in the pre-web days of the Internet, focusing on the volunteer efforts of building and maintaining of community.  This is an era it's worth remembering, but also deserves a reflection on its failings as well.

* I fast forward to current content moderation debates in **"[De-platforming is censure not censorship.](https://joncamfield.com/blog/2021.04/de-platforming-is-censure-not-censorship.html)"**, where we have traded the increasing pains of managing these small communities for massively centralized, profit-seeking social media platforms (in parallel with a general centralization of Internet infrastructure), and use the Parler "takedown" as an example of just how hard you have to try to actually get fully "de-platformed," and to start a discussion of why we need to flip this narrative to being one of why these powerful megaphone-giving tools are providing their platforms to violent hate speech, when there are - if you read beyond the headlines and hubris - so many functional options.

* Finally, in **"[Centering Decentralization](https://joncamfield.com/blog/2021.05/centering-decentralization)"**, I cover the real costs in untangling ourselves from centralized platforms. It's neither possible nor useful to recreate the community feeling of the proto-Internet days.  There is however, value in building towards a more deeply inclusive combination of systems and platforms that restores community ownership and protects free speech, but also doesn't hand out megaphones.

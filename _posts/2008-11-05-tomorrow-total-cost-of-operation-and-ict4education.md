"Total cost of ownership" (TCO) is often  underestimated, sometimes grossly, when 
calculating costs of ICT in education initiatives  in developing countries. 
Estimates of initial costs to purchase equipment  to overall costs over time vary
widely; typically they lie between 10-25% of total  cost. That said, there is a
dearth of reliable data, and useful tools, to help  guide education
decisionmakers in their assessments of the true  costs of educational technology
initiatives.<br />
  <br />
  A recent whitepaper from Vital Wave  Consulting, "Affordable Computing for
  Schools in Developing Countries: A Total Cost of  Ownership (TCO) Model for
  Education Officials", and accompanying case  study of ICT in education
  initiatives in India, provide further insight and  perspective on this important
  and often controversial issue.  The  white paper discusses key issues related
to technology use in education and presents  several major findings, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Academic research and  private-sector investment decisions indicate that
    computers in schools  contribute to improved academic outcomes, boost a
    nation's economic  competitiveness, and attract job-creating economic
    investments.Governments need to consider  the entire cost of school computing 
    solutions, rather than merely  the initial expenses. A total cost of ownership model takes into  account recurrent and hidden costs such as
    teacher training, support and  maintenance, and the cost of replacing<br />
    hardware over a five-year  period.</li>
  <li> Support and training are  recurrent costs that constitute two of the three
    largest costs in the total  cost of ownership model. They are greater than
    hardware costs and much higher  than software fees.</li>
  <li> Ultra-low cost computers and  Linux-based solutions are relatively equal in
    cost to traditional hardware  and proprietary software solutions because
    they require higher labor and  replacement costs over a five-year period.,
    The total cost of ownership  for different computer types and software
    platforms is relatively  consistent.</li>
</ul>
<p>  Please note that this independent study was  commissioned by Microsoft.<br />
  <br />
  Come join what we hope to be a lively presentation  and discussion of the
  findings of this study, their potential  implications, and the underlying
  methodologies and assumptions underpinning the  models explored in this work.<br />
  <br />
  We will kick off the discussion with comments from  Jon Camfield, Director of
  Information and Communication Technologies at YSA  (Youth Service America), who
  has co-authored an update to the TCO Tool for  schools developed by the Global
  e-Schools and Communities Initiative (GeSCI).  This tool, "Deploying 1:1
  educational models in large scale: a practical  budgeting tool based on TCO", is<br />
  available for free use under a Creative Commons  License and is currently being
  utilized as part of planning processes in Rwanda,  drawing on lessons learned
  from its earlier use elsewhere in Africa, most  notably in Namibia.<br />

Now, normally this isn't something I'd sign on with, but <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/-/human-rights-video/">Global Voices Online</a> is hosting a video log of human rights abuses.  Some shot with cell phones, others with home video cameras.  I think it's a splendid idea.  This is a different side of "development;" it's not so much worrying about capacity building as it is stopping monstrosities, and any outlet to raise awareness of these abuses I feel is worthwhile. This one, from a smuggled DVD, shows police cracking down on a peaceful union protest in Zimbabwe"<br />

excerpt: Through the magic of technology, <a href="http://www.crisscrossed.net/2010/01/15/5-innovative-examples-for-worldwide-maptivism/">this
  post at CrissCrossed.net</a> from January just popped up on my radar, covering examples
  of using the one-two visual and data-rich impact of maps for activism.  His examples
  cover <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2009/11/02/bloggers-put-china%E2%80%99s-pollution-on-the-map/">pollution
  reporting in China</a>, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2009/11/using-mobile-phones-to-map-the-slums-of-brazil311.html">community
  mapping in Brazil</a> and others.  Add to that the <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a>-powered
  <a href="http://www.oilspill.labucketbrigade.org/">BP Oil Spill Crisis Map</a> and
  of course the gamechanging effects of incident reporting and crisismapping in immediate
  the aftermath of the <a href="http://haiti.ushahidi.com/">Haiti earthquake</a>,
  and you have a sea-change in the ability to respond to a problem with geographic
  dimensions quickly, and with data-driven, crowdsource-able maps.  This ability is
  largely thanks to the work of <a href="http://ushahidi.com">Ushahidi</a> (which
  now even supports remote reporting via <a href="http://blog.ushahidi.com/index.php/2010/07/16/call-to-report-feature-via-cloudvox/">voice
  calls</a>) and projects like <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street
  Map</a>.

 A few weeks back, I saw this show, "The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs"  at the <a href="http://www.woollymammoth.net/performances/show_steve_jobs.php">Woolly Mammoth</a>.  It's by <a href="http://mikedaisey.blogspot.com">Mike Daisey</a>, and is a work of non-fiction, describing his experiences infiltrating electronics factories in China (read a bit about that at <a href="abcnews.go.com/Technology/man-show-spins-story-steve-jobs-genius-shocking/story?id=12743763">ABC News</a>, and watch the embedded TechCrunch interview.  It's playing in Seattle soon, and might come back to DC eventually.  It is absolutely worth watching.  It perfectly captures the Apple fanboy, and technology enthusiasts in general, and will have you howling with laughter at you see yourself in his portrayals of these characters.  By the end, however, you may not want to touch your iPhone.  Or buy one.  Or consider the conditions under which it was made.

To add on to that, Apple just got named as the <a href="http://slatest.slate.com/id/2291777?wpisrc=sl_ipad">least green tech company</a> by GreenPeace, focusing primarily on their coal-powered data centers.  Facebook came in second, while Yahoo, Google and Amazon were praised for their use of clean energy.

It seems that the <a href="https://www.mobilemag.com/content/100/334/C7236/">Mobile Mag/News.com.com article</a> I referenced in <a href="https://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2006.04/post.html">this entry</a> was pretty much entirely factually incorrect; and the <a href="https://laptop.org">OLPC team</a> is using a Fedora variant (Debian would be better, but hey).  More info on their <a href="https://wiki.laptop.org/index.php/OLPC_on_open_source_software">dedication to Open Source Software at their wiki</a>, and finally some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/pete/sets/72057594143224765/">real photos!</a>

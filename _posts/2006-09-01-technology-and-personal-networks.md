I'm reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=griffjoncom&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=%2FTechnology-Social-Inclusion-Rethinking-Digital%2Fdp%2F0262232243%2Fref%3Dsr_11_1%3Fie%3DUTF8">Technology and Social Inclusion</a>, which is a fascinating book on the role of ICT in development, looking internationally and within underserved/poor/rural US communities as well.  Today on Slashdot, there's a story on <a href="https://tastyresearch.wordpress.com/2006/08/31/does-the-internet-improve-social-relationships-and-psychological-well-being/">the Internet improving, not replacing social ties/networks</a>, which connects well both with the Human/Social resources chapters of this book on the importance of communties of practice and social networks, and of course the social capital theories of Granovetter and crowd.</p>

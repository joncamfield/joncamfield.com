<p>It was a fascinating discussion.  I'm a strong supporter of sustainability (otherwise, why bother?) and Al Hammond gives a passionate and convincing argument for the central role of business in creating sustainable solutions.

<p>I can only imagine that once mBanking really gets rolling, all doubt will be erased that the cell phone has helped the Next Four Billion more than 2.3 trillion dollars in aid.  My mind quickly out-paces itself when I begin to ponder mBanking benefits for everyone from rural artisania workers able to take and receive payments for commissioned artwork to p2p payment systems to direct-to-market agricultural benefits...  </p>

<p>Now, I have a few outstanding doubts about some parts of these two plans - some scalability and malicious-user problems with the Vietnam model, and some privacy and franchise-enforcement questions with the healthcare idea.    Now, I have fewer doubts on both of these concepts, combined, than, say, the <a href="http://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2008/06/a_quick_summary_of_the_olpc_pr.html">OLPC Project</a> (though I strongly believe that a <a href="http://joncamfield.com/blog/2008/03/rethinking_the_olpc_distributi.html">base-of-the-pyramid approach to 
the OLPC</a> could work well).  The huge difference between a BoP, market-driven approach and traditional development is that investors bear the brunt of failed projects, a pleasant change from the recipient country being in deeper debt regardless of the outcomes of debt-financed aid projects.  I think traditional development will forever have a role in humanitarian and post-conflict aid, but in infrastructure and service creation, the BoP, private-sector approach will prove long-term much stronger than pure-play foreign aid programs, for the simple reason that it applies reasonable risk management to development projects.  What a concept!</p>

<p>Without further ado, my full meeting notes after the jump...</p>

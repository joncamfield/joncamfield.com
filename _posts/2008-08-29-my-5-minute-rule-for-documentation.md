title: My 5 Minute Rule for Documentation

<p>I have a policy which I follow religiously regarding when to document something, which I promote to my co-workers when training them on the staff wikis I create wherever I go -- and trust me, I leave wikis like a trail of breadcrumbs in every organization I touch. I've made wikis for my <a href="http://whagwan.org">Peace Corps group</a>, my <a href="http://www.joncamfield.com/blog/gwu.edu/~cistp">grad school program</a>, UT's <a href="http://www.otc.utexas.edu/">Office of Technology Commercialization</a>, <a href="http://crisislink.org">CrisisLink</a>, and <a href="http://www.ysa.org">Youth Service America</a>, and myself of course.</p>

<p>My rule is that if something takes you more than 5 minutes to figure out, it's worth a few second on the wiki - if absolutely nothing more than to jot down the key ah-ha!s so as to provide a roadmap to others.  Ideally you add in a lot more guidance around that, but we all know how documentation generally goes.</p>

<p>But even that 30-second note can remind you, or whoever takes over your position when you move on, with a shortcut through the (re-)learning curve, and it's saved me countless times.  And if you do it in the moment of post-revelation euphoria, it gives you a perfect opportunity to reflect on the process and see if, in your excitement of getting something working, you've left out an important step.  Really, it's made of win all around.</p>

<p>In that spirit, I don't have a better place to stick this information, so I'll just post it here.  I'm generally all for categorization and such, but google will cover my a$$ when I'm lazy.</p>

<p>I just spent far too many minutes (ok, hours) trying to get Drupal to show maps with specific taxonomy terms filtered.  I first thought I could just replace the /node after /map  with /term/4 or /taxonomy/term/4 - and indeed, this will work, but only if you set up a new view (gmap view type) with (at a bare minimum) Lat/Long as fields and Taxomomy term ID (or name) as an argument.  It's that simple (cough) but not clear and I found it exceptionally difficult to google on, though I eventually found a lot of resources on doing maps by taxonomy term by searching google for gmap view.</p>

<p>That's three grand, not third generation.  A (possibly biased) <a href="http://vitalwaveconsulting.com/insights/Vital%20Wave%20Consulting%20Affordable%20Computing%20TCO%20INDIA_June08.pdf">report by Vital Wave</a> pegs the 5 year TCO of the OLPC at $2,700.  That's even more than my estimate of <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/price/the_real_cost_of_the.html">$972/laptop</a> from back in 2006, which got me in <a href="http://hardware.newsforge.com/hardware/06/12/01/1546208.shtml?tid=61&tid=3">NewsForge</a> and called a racist child-hater in <a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/08/2217257">Slashdot</a>.</p>

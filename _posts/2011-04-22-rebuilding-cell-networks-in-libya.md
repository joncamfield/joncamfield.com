Via <a href="http://www.mobileactive.org/mobile-minute-4-15-2011">MobileActive</a>, I got to reading <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703841904576256512991215284.html">this article at the WSJ</a>.

Unsurprisingly, the Libyan cell network is built to be Tripoli-centric, "giving him and his intelligence agents full control over phones and Internet" according to the WSJ.  If that's not a stark reminder of the challenges of using SMS and mobiles in human rights work that I've <a href="http://joncamfield.com/blog/2009/05/after_the_sms_honeymoon.html">been concerned about</a>, I don't know what is.

The brilliant response here has been to wrest control over segments of the Libyan mobile network.  This has taken some outside effort, external government support, and massive funding - it is, at least for now, successful at creating an independent domestic network with limited external access:

<blockquote>A team led by a Libyan-American telecom executive has helped rebels hijack Col. Moammar Gadhafi's cellphone network and re-establish their own communications.

The new network, first plotted on an airplane napkin and assembled with the help of oil-rich Arab nations, is giving more than two million Libyans their first connections to each other and the outside world after Col. Gadhafi cut off their telephone and Internet service about a month ago.

That March cutoff had rebels waving flags to communicate on the battlefield. The new cellphone network, opened on April 2, has become the opposition's main tool for communicating from the front lines in the east and up the chain of command to rebel brass hundreds of miles away.</blockquote>

We're missing the point here, as usual.  ICT4D is not about the ICT, it's about the "D" - Development.

Yes, the XO-1, being specifically designed for harsher environments is a great addition to the toolchest, but not by itself a reason to start a new ICT4D program - just a better tool to use if there's a need for it.  The XO-2 and the $10 "laptop" (which sounds more like a USB harddrive) might also add tools.  They might flop or never coalesce (or meet their price point goals!).

As technologists in development, we must dampen our tendency to get excited over the technology and instead use our knowledge of all the technology options (not just the newest and shiniest), and get excited instead over the development challenges.  Luckily, there's a lot to be excited on.

So, can we now stop gushing over vaporware announcements and get back to work?

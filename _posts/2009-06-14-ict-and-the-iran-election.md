I find it wonderful that these things are possible, and that social media and mobile technology continue to outpace censorship, but this honeymoon is drawing to a close.  Whether it be <a href="https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.04/twittering_about_a_revolution.html">disabling SMS during Moldova "pman" protests</a>, or <a href="https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.05/update_on_guatemala_twitter_ar.html">arresting twitter users in Guatemala</a>, and the more stringent methods Iran seems to be employing - <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/6/13/742004/-Updated:-Breaking-Mousavi-Arrested:-Rafsanjani-Resigns,-Iranian-Police-Fleeing-from-Demonstrators">cutting phone lines and dragging Internet access to a crawl</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.boingboing.net/2009/06/13/iran-sms-networks-my.html">shutting down SMS pre-election</a> (and in China, before <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/165914/china_blocks_twitter_ahead_of_tiananmen_anniversary.html">The Tianenmen Square Anniversary</a>) governments are wising up and becoming more proactive in moderating and censoring citizen media.

I mentioned this after the DC Mobile For Change conference <a href="https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.05/after_the_sms_honeymoon_update.html">here</a>, and I continue to worry about it.  Any centralized network is susceptible to control - meaning that the amazing new tool we have in mobile technology for immediate information (especially <a href="https://crisiscamp.org/">during crises</a>, is at risk of being crippled where it could be most useful.

Thoughts?

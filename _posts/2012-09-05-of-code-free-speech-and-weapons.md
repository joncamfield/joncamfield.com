<p>Quick quiz. &nbsp;Which of these should not be protected as free speech?</p><p>[ ] A gun (you know, the kind you can hold and shoot)</p><p>[ ] Plans for a nuclear weapon</p><p>[ ] Political statements (lots and lots of them)</p><p>[ ] Detailed instructions on how to communicate privately</p><p>[ ]&nbsp;Detailed instructions on how to make an archival, digital copy of a DVD</p><p>The answer is either none or all of the above - we are in a world where free speech (in the form of computer code) can create real world objects and actions that are themselves regulated or outright illegal. &nbsp;But if the action is illegal, is the code that causes it also illegal? &nbsp;If so, the line gets very blurry very quickly. &nbsp;If not, we still have some fascinating problems to deal with, like printable guns. &nbsp;Regardless, we need to educate policy makers to understand this digital frontier and be prepared to defend free speech when this gets unpleasant. &nbsp;Spoiler: It&#39;s already unpleasant. &nbsp;Our world is defined by code, where programmed actions have very real, tangible effects.</p><h3>Code of Protest</h3><p>Civil disobedience can take some weird forms. While today masked digital vigilantes of Anonymous act as a curious type of Internet immune system; reacting against gross infringements of cyber liberty, their methods are not as new as you might think. &nbsp;In the late 90s, the Electronic Disturbance Theater (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Disturbance_Theater" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Disturbance_Theater</a>) was supporting the Zapatistas by flooding Mexican government sites with a rudimentary DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, which brings a webserver down by overloading it. &nbsp;This concept is at the heart of LOIC, Anonymous&#39;s &quot;Low Orbit Ion Cannon&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon</a>). &nbsp;EDT&#39;s version, &quot;Floodnet,&quot; had the nice touch of requesting webpages with names like &quot;human rights&quot; from the government sites, resulting in errors clogging up the server reading something like &quot;404 - human rights not found.&quot; &nbsp;Asking for a webpage is pretty clearly something akin to shouting at a rally, or a &quot;cyber sit-in&quot; (<a href="https://angelingo.usc.edu/index.php/politics/cyber-sit-ins-grassroots-to-gigabytes/" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://angelingo.usc.edu/index.php/politics/cyber-sit-ins-grassroots-to-gigabytes/</a>) - get enough people to do it, and it causes some level of annoyance - but it&#39;s still an act of speech.</p><h3>Free speech and a dead-end for copy controls</h3><div>More compelling is the story of decss. CSS, an acronym now known as a web design tool, also means Content Scramble System, and is how DVD content is locked down. Only authorized hardware and software can decrypt a DVD and play it. This theoretically prevents wanton piracy, but it also prevents you from exercising your rights of fair use, backing up, or watching on a device of your choosing.</div><p>Fortunately, CSS was not particularly well crafted, and was quickly and thoroughly broken with a chunk of code nicknamed decss by a Norwegian teenager nicknamed &quot;DVD Jon&quot;. &nbsp;This caused a slight bit of controversy. &nbsp;DVD Jon was accused of theft in Norway, and users in the States were threatened with fines and jailtime for re-distributing it under the DMCA law.</p><p>In a predictable story arc, the next chapter of this story is of course the Internet digerati of the day getting royally teed off and causing a ruckus. The &nbsp;source code of decss was immediately turned into graphic art, secretly embedded in photos, turned into poems, and even a song (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GekuuNqAiQg" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GekuuNqAiQg</a>) - a gallery of creative works using or containing the decss code remains online:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/DeCSS/Gallery/</a>&nbsp;. &nbsp;DVD Jon won his case (<a href="https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3341211.stm" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3341211.stm</a>) and we all celebrated the somewhat obvious win for free speech and consumer power.</p><h3>Private speech and munitions export controls</h3><p>We can rewind even further back to the early 90s, when Phillip Zimmerman published the entire source code of his powerful encryption tool, PGP, in a book (of the paper, box-shaped physical object type). &nbsp;Now, encryption this powerful was classified (until 1996) as a &quot;munition&quot; and subject to export controls with the types of penalties you might expect for selling military equipment on the black market. &nbsp;Had PGP been released as a&nbsp;program, it would obviously fall into this categorization. &nbsp;As text in a book, however, it appeared to be protected as free speech. &nbsp;The stupidity of the distinction of course also spurred many to make t-shirts and code snippets of this &quot;illegal&quot; code. &nbsp;Eventually, a series of court cases (Bernstein v. United States,&nbsp;Junger v. Daley) establishing that source code, indeed, counts as free speech.</p><h3>Free speech and real munitions</h3><div>Fast forward back to today, and the distinction between code and munitions is again somewhat unclear - with 3D printers, you can even begin building core pieces or real munitions - like, well, guns (<a href="https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/3d-weapons/" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/3d-weapons/</a>), based on digital blueprints and DIY-enthusiast at-home 3D printing kits. &nbsp;For anyone who doubts that print-at-home guns couldn&#39;t possibly be thought of as pure expressions of free speech, covered by copyright laws and software licensing more than gun laws, I recommend browsing through this video and transcript;&nbsp;(<a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/09/04/1837209/should-we-print-guns-cody-r-wilson-says-yes-video#media" id="" shape="rect" target="_blank">https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/09/04/1837209/should-we-print-guns-cody-r-wilson-says-yes-video#media</a>)with the clear excitement around innovation and failure-as-a-feature in the gun printing market by Cody Wilson of Defense Distributed.</div><h3>Code is speech, code is reality.</h3><div>The kicker here remains that code - that mysterious language that creates everything from Skype (now illegal to use in Ethiopia, with up to 15 years of jailtime) to your bank&#39;s software to this webpage - is also, at its core, just ideas and language. &nbsp;Now, disruptive ideas have always been a bit dangerous, and we have a long, if rarely permanently successful history of ways to limit, erase and squelch them. &nbsp;But ideas that themselves are actions are another thing altogether.</div><p>In linguistics, you have the concept of &quot;Illocutionary Acts&quot; - acts which are embodied in language. &nbsp;There aren&#39;t many - no matter how I say that I&#39;m going to go for an after-work run, the act of running can only be done by my whole body. &nbsp;Oaths are the best example of these acts - speaking the oath is making the oath, and that combination of idea and action is a powerful sentiment.</p><p>And every line of code can be just as powerful.</p><!--break-->

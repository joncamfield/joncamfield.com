My favorite technology in this realm of empowerment remains FrontlineSMS.  Last year, I cajoled my <a href="http://joncamfield.com/category/tags/olpc">OLPC XO-1</a> into <a href="http://joncamfield.com/blog/2009/03/a_revolution_you_can_run_with_.html">running  FrontlineSMS</a> - combining the XO's hardy but lightweight construction, full-sun-readable screen, and grid-free capabilities with FrontlineSMS's ability to run an SMS messaging center without Internet access.  These two combine into a completely mobile SMS command center that can be recharged using car batteries or solar panels, moved quickly, and ditched almost instantaneously (presuming you run a "guest" OS from the OLPC's SD card slot).  This applies now to a new wave of netbook computers with even better batteries (though many are not built quite as well as the XO for ... let's say "non-standard" usage).

It took a few decades, but we now have technology which is powerful enough and popular enough to support a global revolution in how "development" happens.  It no longer means a visit from a white USAID SUV, or even a health worker motocycling out to check the medicine stocks of a remote clinic.  A well-targeted SMS message can reach any part of the world, or just over the horizon to a colleague you want to ask a question of without spending a day and wasting gasoline in transit.  More importantly, the "headquarters" of an organization is no longer tied to a central office, or necessarily needs to pay for reliable Internet to communicate with its members/beneficiaries/activists.  This enables a renaissance of new local solutions to local problems, and that is exciting impact that has only just begun.

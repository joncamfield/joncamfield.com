http://ictfordevelopment.wordpress.com/  provides a podcast on ICT issues in development.  Because, y'know, audio is a very searchable, bandwidth-friendly medium that has multiple tools available for crude but functional machine translation, just like, oh, I dunno, a plain text blog?  I mean, yay podcasts, but I wasn't about to waste my 28.8kbps (on good days) GPRS connection to the Internet on downloading podcasts when I was working in Ja, not to mention that English audio is even more of a barrier than English text to non-native speakers, who are probably the people who'd benefit the most from this content.

Oh wait, it does have "Vodcasts" - video content.  My mistake.

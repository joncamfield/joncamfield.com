<p>Global Youth Service Day will be brought to you in live <a href="https://www.twitter.com/gysdevents" target="_blank">Twitter</a> form with event updates (and locations, to broadcast on <a href="https://www.twittervision.com" target="_blank">TwitterVision.com</a>) throughout the day.</p>

<p>I'm using <a href="https://booktwo.org/swotter/" target="_blank">Swotter</a> to push out the events we have in our Google Spreadsheet (exported to a more SMS-length-friendly format), which is also driving our <a href="https://tools.ysa.org/map/gysd.html" target="_blank">GYSD-US Map</a> (warning: VERY resource heavy Simile/Exhibit Map Mashup).  I love technology that likes to talk together!</p>

<p>It's pushing the events straight through the API, and then a combination of <a href="https://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2008.04/twittering-for-global-youth-se.html">TweetScan</a> and <a href="https://twitterfeed.com/">TwitterFeed</a>s are retweeting any #gysd tagged tweets, which was <a href="https://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2008.04/twittering-for-global-youth-se.html">my original gysd/twitter plan</a></p>

<p>So... we'll see how it goes...</p>

  <p>You might remember the Youtube video of this guy named Matt who did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNF_P281Uu4">this silly dance and captured it on video everywhere he went</a> a few years ago?  </p>

  <p>Well.. he's back, <a href="https://wherethehellismatt.com/">with friends</a>.</p>

  <p>It's a good video to watch when you worry about things like war, unfair trade practices, poor foreign policy, dictatorship, and so on -- it reminds you that people are globally friendly, silly, happy folk if given a chance.  Which is always true, but not always easy to remember.</p>

If May 3rd gets to be <a href="http://joncamfield.com/blog/2011/05/celebrating_world_press">World Press Freedom Day</a>, then after today's events, July 14 (in addition to already being Bastille Day) should be Citizen Media Day.

The "celebrations" really started yesterday, with Ashoka Changemakers (with the support of Google) launching a global competition (fully supported in nine languages, no less) to <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/citizenmedia">source innovative ideas in citizen media</a>. I've got to say, I love how the timeline goes "backwards" in Right-to-Left languages <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B7%D9%86">like Arabic</a>.  Many thanks to our work with Ashoka Israel in launching <a href="http://kikar.changemakers.com"> Kikar (loosely, "Market square")</a> in Hebrew.

Today, the <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/blog">Changemakers blog</a> is buzzing with amazing citizen media stories from Ashoka fellows and others, leading up to a <a href="http://www.changemakers.com/blog/join-us-july-14th-socentchat-boosting-global-media-access">#SocEntChat today on Twitter at 2pm EDT</a>.

Later in the day, at 5:30pm, I will be moderating a panel on "Online Activism after #ArabSpring : What's Next?" - there are a few seats still available, more information and RSVP at  http://www.meetup.com/intlrel-76/events/23103221/ .  Follow along on twitter with the hashtag #AAS, and there's a remote possibility we may be able to livestream the event.

Finally, we get to wind down at Circa Bistro with a happy hour co-hosted with ICTWorks - information and RSVP here: http://ict4drinks-july14.eventbrite.com/.

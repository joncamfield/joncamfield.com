<ul><li>not helpful that there's competition on which side of street to drive on; role for govt for standards
</li></ul>
</li><li>IP matters "true believer" in patents and copyright done properly to get return on R&D, Sun is 43 worldwide in  R&D spending cross-sector
</li></ul>
</li><li>No one owns language: common language of the internet should be free ("I'd love to own english; I'd even take French") imagine if anyone owned "y" and charged a nickle?
<ul><li>not the way the computer industry had been or should go
</li></ul>
</li><li>Sun cause at start (kept low profile)

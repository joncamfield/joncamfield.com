<!--break-->
Dubbed Magalhaes (Magellan), the laptops will have on board low-power Intel Atom chips designed for laptops. They will also sport digital cameras and a broadband net connection. 

<p>It is somewhaimplied in the article that the Magellan won't have wifi on-board, but I can hardly imagine that is true. As for the software, the original Portugal deal made it clear that there would be a <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/intel/classmate_pc_children_portugal.html">choice between Windows or Ubuntu Linux</a>,   and <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/software/operating_system/sugarizing_it_intel_classmate_2.html">Sugar has been ported for the very similar Classmate 2</a>.  Venezuela is going to go their own way: "The machines will run a version of Linux developed in Venezuela." </p>

<p>It seems like they're going to an awfully lot of work to create an XO without buying them from OLPC.</p>

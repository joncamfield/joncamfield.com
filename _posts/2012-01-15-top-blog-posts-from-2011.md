Not a very bloggy year, but I like to think I made up for quantity with quality.  By far and away, the most popular post I wrote in 2011 was <a href="/blog/2011/08/privacy_trust_nymwars_and">Privacy, Trust, NymWars, and Social Change</a>, in which I tried to clarify why pseudonyms are valuable in online civic discourse.

Coming in second, <a href="/blog/2011/08/monitoring_and_evaluation_is">Monitoring and Evaluation is broken. Let's really break it.</a> - a gripe on the somewhat depressing state of M&E, especially in the tech4dev world, based on a discussion at the DC <a href="http://technologysalon.org/2011/07/what-are-effecitve-ict-tools-f.html">Technology Salon</a>.

In third place, we have my calling on the #Occupy crowd to get beyond building sustainable tent cities and get down to loca, domestic and glocal action: <a href="/blog/2011/10/in_the_global_mirror_the_ows">In the Global Mirror, the #OWS 99% looks a lot like the 1%</a>

Following on from that, a piece calling for voting support for <a href="/blog/2011/07/vote_for_economic_opportunity">Changemakers' Economic Opportunity competition</a>.

Finishing fifth, <a href="/blog/2011/11/the_art_of_failing">The Art of Failing</a>, where I discuss DC's own FailFaire and the value of talking about projects that didn't go so well.

Next, <a href="/blog/2011/10/back_from_dakar_how_i_built_a">Back from Dakar: How I built a Drupal 7 site in 7 days</a>,

In seventh place, <a href="/blog/2011/04/apples_that_are_neither_green">Apples that are neither green nor easy to digest.</a>, a discussion about Mike Daisey's coverage of Apple, which is thankfully <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/454/mr-daisey-and-the-apple-factory">back in the news</a> and <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/story/12/01/15/1657256/apple-to-release-list-of-companies-that-build-its-products-around-the-world">causing change</a>!

Eight is indeed great, with my post advertising my panel at <a href="/blog/2011/10/tech_trends_come_discuss_at">DCWeek 2011 on Tech Trends</a>

Ninth is <a href="/blog/2011/04/the_jasmine_revolution">The Jasmine Revolution</a>, a fascinating social media blip in China.

Finally at tenth spot is <a href="/blog/2011/06/online_activism_after">Online Activism after #ArabSpring : What's Next?</a>, an event at IREX I moderated for the DC <a href="http://www.meetup.com/intlrel-76/">ICT4D Meetup</a>.

It was, it seems, a busy year.

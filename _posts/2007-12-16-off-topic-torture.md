<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/12/14/bashmilah/">Salon.com</a> has an exclusive article detailing the detainment of an innocent Yemeni citizen in CIA's black site prisons:</p>

The guards wore black masks and black clothes. They would not utter a word as they extracted Bashmilah from his cell for interrogation -- one of his few interactions with other human beings during his entire 19 months of imprisonment. Nobody told him where he was, or if he would ever be freed.

<p>It was enough to drive anyone crazy. Bashmilah finally tried to slash his wrists with a small piece of metal, smearing the words "I am innocent" in blood on the walls of his cell. But the CIA patched him up.</p>

<p>So Bashmilah stopped eating. But after his weight dropped to 90 pounds, he was dragged into an interrogation room, where they rammed a tube down his nose and into his stomach. Liquid was pumped in.</p>

<p>Mark Twain once said; "Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it."  I haven't supported my government for a long time, and I've almost lost all support for even my country when things like this come to light on a weekly basis and fall on deaf ears.</p>

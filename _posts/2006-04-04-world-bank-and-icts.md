<p>I think I'm pretty much obligated to talk about the <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTINFORMATIONANDCOMMUNICATIONANDTECHNOLOGIES/0,,contentMDK:20831214~pagePK:210058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:282823,00.html">World Bank's ICT data and report</a> about "Investments in information and communication technologies (ICT) in developing countries will reach 100 billion dollars annually over the next five years."</p>

<p>Beyond validating my career path choice, it will hopefully get the mass statistical engines of the Bank brining in more data on ICT projects and success.</p>

<p>It remains my fear (which this report only increases) that ICT is going to be a big, money-draining fad in development, and pull money away from more basic humanitarian, health, social, and educational needs.  Yes, computers are important in trying to prevent a truly massive division between the "North" and the "South," but we can't put our blinders on.</p>

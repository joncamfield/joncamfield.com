excerpt: "I've long been an advocate for <a href=\"https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.01/the-xo-files-part-iv-new-years.html\">selling
  the XO commercially</a> or at least following a Grameen Village Phone style approach
  to create <a href=\"https://joncamfield.com/blog/2008.03/rethinking-the-olpc.html\">OLPC
  XO-centric small business models</a>.  Or simply just enable <a href=\"https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.02/small-is-bigger-than-big-for-o.html\">smaller
  pilot projects</a> to spread the XO technology.  I still believe any or all of these
  offer amazing benefits to expanding the scale of the OLPC XO, re-establishing the
  XO as the dominant player in the low-cost, rugged, low-infrastructure-requirements
  laptop, ideal for education projects around the world.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem
  to be getting much traction, despite apparent interest.  Let me propose a different
  path forward, closer to the original \"we sell laptops in batches of 1 million or
  more to governments\" idea:  <strong>Drop education</strong>.\r\n\r\nDon't get me
  wrong - education is absolutely key to development, and the OLPC XO can be a great
  tool for education.  But education systems also need to invest in teacher training,
  school infrastructure (from simple, double-ventilated pit latrines all the way to
  electricity and computers).\r\n\r\nBut there are so many other areas where something
  like the XO could help.  Anywhere that cell phones are established as data-reporting
  tools is a potential place to introduce an XO.  The laptop is barely more resource-hungry
  than a cell phone in terms of power, and can work \"off-grid\" with solar or car
  batteries just as well.  It can deploy without any central communications grid (unlike
  a cell phone), given enough XOs or mesh extending devices to maintain an active
  peer-to-peer mesh network, and add one satellite uplink or cell-modem into the system
  and you're online.  More importantly, if the cell network is down, a mesh network
  still can pass along messages within a small area.  \r\n\r\nEven a simple OLPC can
  still provide a much more rich data reporting toolset than coding long strings of
  data into a 160 character SMS, not to mention the ability to add in encryption for
  personal security and not relying (necessarily) on a central network which could
  be compromised.\r\n\r\nWhat are some areas that such a device could provide valuable
  tools?  Crisis response would be one obvious win, but also health reporting and/or
  managing reports being filed, human rights violations, election reporting, and even
  something like agricultural data exchange, enabling farmers to \"pull\" and explore
  information on long-term weather forecasts, disease risks, and market prices.\r\n\r\nCombine
  an XO with <a href=\"https://frontlinesms.com/\">FrontLineSMS</a> and you have a
  portable, solar-powered SMS communications hub, which I can see being valuable in
  a few tough situations if you had some manual encryption schemes set up with your
  constituents.\r\n\r\nAccepted, the XO is more expensive and would require more training
  than a simple cell phone.  It could not -- <a href=\"https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.03/mobiles-vs-computers.html\">and
  should not</a> -- replace cell phone deployments, as a cell phone can go longer
  without power and is less \"flashy\" than an XO.  But hybrid systems involving OLPC
  XOs <em>as well as</em> cell phones, or using XOs as portable SMS-messaging hubs,
  or simply to quickly deploy a local area wifi mesh network are all clear needs that
  an OLPC XO could help with.\r\n"

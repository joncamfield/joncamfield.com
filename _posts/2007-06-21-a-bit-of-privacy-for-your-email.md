<p><a href="https://news.monstersandcritics.com/intelandterror/article_1320410.php/The_privacy_of_Internet_e-mail">The AP reports</a> that email may now enjoy 4th amendment rights:</p>

A U.S. appeals court in Ohio has ruled that e-mail messages stored on Internet servers are protected by the Constitution as are telephone conversations and that a federal law permitting warrantless secret searches of e-mail violates the Fourth Amendment. [...]

<p>'The District Court correctly determined that e-mail users maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in the content of their e-mails,' ruled the three-judge panel.</p>

<p>What a concept!</p>

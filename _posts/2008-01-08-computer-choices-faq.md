<p>People often ask me, as a technology geek, what kind of computer they should get, so I'm putting this post together as a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) to address the most common things people ask about when they're considering a new system:</p>
<dl>
<dt>I'm trying to decide on a laptop: should I get a Dell, Lenovo, HP, Sony, Toshiba, or what?</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I want a simple to use computer for myself/my child/my parents/etc.</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I worry about long-term usability and interoperability with other people</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I've heard about the new Vista and think it looks really cool.  Should I get that, or stick with Windows XP?</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I want a computer that works perfectly with my home wireless network</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I want to be able to create and watch movies</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I want a desktop system that's powerful</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I want a Mac, but I hear they're too expensive.  After you consider the hassles and anti-virus software and repair bills of a Windows computer, which one do you recommend?</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I'd love to move to Mac, but have this Windows program I HAVE TO USE.  Can I use some program or dual-boot with windows to use that when I have to?  What should I choose?</dt>
<dd>Get a Mac</dd>
<dt>I'm a total geek and am wiling to do roll up my sleeves and do some behind-the-scenes tweaking to have the latest and greatest things working on my computer.</dt>
<dd>Get a PC with Linux.  Or a Mac :)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope this clarifies things regarding what computer systems are the best value and utility out there.<p>

<p>I'm currently using the laptop as the interim solution / testbed for the LAS idea.  It's struggling to run amarok, but works nicely with qiv running a slideshow on top of it, usually.</p>

<p>I think I fixed it, but it had a habit of randomly creating a playlist after it was done playing whatever we'd asked it to - i.e. selecting songs at random from our libraries.  It's cute, until it pulls up an audiobook chapter, or Chainsaws and Children (a metal/rave CD I won at Defcon many years ago for knowing that the Battle of Hastings did not occur on a power-of-two year (like 1024).  And they all said that a liberal education was a worthless pursuit!)</p>

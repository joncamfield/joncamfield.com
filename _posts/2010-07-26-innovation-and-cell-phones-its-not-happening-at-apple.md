  models. Nokia tends to be the  dominant player in those markets, so people tend

<p /> The exciting part is that this is hardware work, moving beyond  innovation in services like using prepaid cell credit as transnational  currency. While that's nothing new to the knockoff markets in China,  seeing this spread internationally - and through an increasingly  networked group of hackers - is exciting.</div>

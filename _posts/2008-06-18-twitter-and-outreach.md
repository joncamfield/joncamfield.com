<p>I'm sure you're tired of hearing me talk about twitter as an innovative and easy tool for outreach and engagement.  So listen instead to <a href="http://www.contentious.com/2008/06/18/mars-phoenix-talked-to-me/">Amy Gahran and her conversation with the Mars Phoenix rover - via twitter</a>:</p>

This is one of the smartest uses of Twitter for public outreach I’ve ever seen — giving folks a sense of a personal connection to this high-tech mission to find water (and signs of life) on Mars. (Some members of the Phoenix team are also blogging.) I especially like that Mars Phoenix is replying to questions sent in by its Twitter friends (like me).

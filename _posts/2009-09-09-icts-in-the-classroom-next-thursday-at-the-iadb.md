excerpt: "Next Thursday at the IADB is a huge event delving into the role of ICTs
  in the classroom, with heavy-hitters including Nicholas Negroponte of OLPC, Tabaré
  Vázquez, the Uruguayan President (no doubt discussing CEIBAL), and Mike Trucano
  of InfoDev, who has been spearheading a cool-headed data-driven look at ICTs --
  See the full schedule and RSVP at  https://events.iadb.org/calendar/eventDetail.aspx?lang=En&id=1444\r\n\r\nCEIBAL
  (Conectividad Educativa de Informática Básica para el Aprendizaje en Línea) is a
  laptop program for public schools in Uruguay, and one of the largest and most active
  OLPC deployments.\r\n\r\nI'll be there asking annoying questions about total costs
  for ICTs versus teacher salaries, problems with software licensing costs, and the
  importance of enabling technology, and taking notes on my cute little OLPC XO laptop.
  \ \r\n\r\nAnd no, I don't see that being incongruous.  "

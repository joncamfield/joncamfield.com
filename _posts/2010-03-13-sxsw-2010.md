excerpt: "I made it to South By Southwest this year, where I immersed myself in innovative
  ideas for open-sourced businesses, technology design for good, social media for
  change, and the general awesome insanity of SXSW.  \r\n\r\nThe absolute best part
  of this conference is the new world of twitter-powered discussions.  At a talk yesterday,
  the entire Q&A session was run over twitter.  The presenters paused a few questions
  in and asked for a show of hands of anyone who was <b>not</b> using twitter.  In
  a large crowded ballroom, no one raised their hands.  Every session ends up having
  a running, silent conversation and collaborative note-taking.\r\n\r\nYou can follow
  my notes in twitter at http://twitter.com/joncamfield, and see what events I went
  to (or was trying to decide between) at http://my.sxsw.com/user/schedule/joncamfield\r\n\r\nOn
  Sunday afternoon, I worked with <A href=\"http://crisiscampdc.ning.com/profile/HeatherBlanchard\">CrisisCamp
  DC's Heather Blanchard</a> and @HastingsCJ to organize a meetup for ICT4D practitioners
  at the Gingerman, which turned our great.  Lots of faces were put to twitter-names,
  connections were made and beer was consumed.  \r\n\r\nFew, if any, tweet-ups will
  compare, however, to Monday night's Good Capitalist party that Ashoka's Changemakers
  co-hosted with a variety of other social entrepreneurship groups.  Without a dime
  of marketing money spent, it had 2000 RSVPs and over 600 people who made it by to
  network, learn about social entrepreneurship, and enjoy the wonderful outdoor Austin
  weather..\r\n\r\n"

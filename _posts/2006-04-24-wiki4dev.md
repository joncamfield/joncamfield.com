So, more as an elaborate bookmarking system than a full wiki (for now), I have installed the latest and greatest MediaWiki server here at JonCamfield.com and am populating it with some of my favorite resources.

<p>Also, in my LAMP insanity, I've also added a <a href="https://www.joncamfield.com/moodle">Moodle</a> (open source course management) system.  Probably won't have time to do much with it for a while, but ideally I'd like to put some short self-paced IT/Dev focused courses in it.</p>

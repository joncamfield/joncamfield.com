The OLPC laptop</a> is fading for me.  Not only is it being a bit vaporware-y, they've dropped the hand-crank, and are planning on running it on WinCE, because Linux is "too bloated". <br clear="left" /></p>

<p>Excuse me?</p>

<p>Sure, the latest Ubuntu comes with lots of bells and whistles that you don't need.  Heck.  Even Knoppix, the grand master of a full OS on a CD, came with a lot of random junk -- even on the level that a not-particularly experience Linux user could see and get rid of (my favorite was that it came with a command line program made to rip MP3s (ok, OGGs) from your vinyl records (with gap detection for track splitting).  There's a LOT of room to cut it down just at the package level -- find a desktop for example that suits your needs but isn't KDE or Gnome.</p>

<p>Then, you can start getting fancy.  For known hardware, you can do a lot of kernel module manipulation, recompiling, and so on.  I really find it hard to believe that WinCE provides a technically better solution; and even if it did... what percent of the $100 is going to be paying for licensing fees?  Oh, or do you have a special deal with MS?  ....How long does it last?  What are the terms?  What's the lock-in?</p>

<p>Though not built for portability, there is a Chinese designed, sourced and soon to be in production <a href="https://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS6301677114.html">$150 miniPC</a> that is running on a Linux variant.  </p>

<p>Should be fun.  I'm just waiting for ANYONE to come out with a sub-$200 full PC.  Preferably closer to the design spec of the OLPC.  But me, I want the crank.  Having been a Dell laptop user for many years, I want a laptop that with sunlight or some handpower, has no need for a battery.<br />

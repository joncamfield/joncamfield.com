 <em>... not my style at all, but that was what I was aiming for: If they think youâ€™re crude, go technical; if they think youâ€™re technical, go crude. Iâ€™m a very technical boy. So I decided to get as crude as possible. These days, though, you have to be pretty technical before you can even aspire to crudeness.</em> --William Gibson, <em>Johnny Mnemonic</em>

<p>Sometimes, providing for the lowest common denominator means you have to get super innovative with your technology; witness the <a href="http://laptop.media.mit.edu/">One Laptop Per Child project</a> (which I have some doubts on the intended implementation, but the design at least is excellent) -- and sometimes, you just have get creative and get your hands dirty.  For this, see the <a href="http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030077">Blue Trunk Libraries</a> for keeping doctors in remote areas up to date with medical advances, using a condensed "library" of books in a rugged, portable blue plastic trunk.</p>

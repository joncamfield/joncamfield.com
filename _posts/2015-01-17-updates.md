You know what hasn't gotten an update in a while?  This blog!  What else?  The cute kittens of digital security over at <a href="http://icanhazdigitalsecurity.tumblr.com/">I can haz digital security?</a>.

The world is busy and imperfect.  But hey, kittens!

Also - an SSL update.  I've added in Cloudflare's Universal SSL to my site, and it communicates with mt backend over the old kinda-broken-ish (but not really!) <a href="https://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2014/02/ssl">CA SSL cert</a>.  I'll be moving to EFF's <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> as soon as it's open for business.  This should clear up most SSL errors for you, and if you really, really care about a direct SSL connection to this site, I trust your ability to securely contact me about getting that working for you.

  <p>I don't have all the bells and whistles that the guy in this movie has running, but maybe it's time to suck it up and upgrade to the newest version.  Aero is Windows Vista's response to the popularity and ease of use of the Mac OSX interface, and Beryl/Compiz is the Linux answer.  This video starts out with Aero, and then switches over to Beryl.  I think it's pretty obvious which one is the winner, especially considering that Beryl is free, whereas running Aero requires Windows Vista, which is selling at Amazon.com for $150 for the lowest-end version of it.</p>

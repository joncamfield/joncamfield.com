<p>Today, Twitter launched one person from their normal Internet life to getting news on the California-regional LAist and valleywag blogs, CNet, a top-rated  digg story, a google search term all to herself, fan-created artwork, and a skyrocketing number of followers inside Twitter.  In three hours, with one twitter.</p>

<p>Read that again.  Three hours, and a message that fit in under 140 characters.  If there was ever an idea that was "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287" target="_blank">Made to Stick</a>", (pardon -- deep apologies, really -- for the truly tasteless pun.)</p>

<p>What created this success?</p>

<p>Some things we can learn from - it was relevant to very current events, it was personal and engaging, and funny.  While not all messages can or should be funny, pulling out an emotion helps.</p>

<p><a href="http://new2oldmedia.wordpress.com/2008/07/29/earthquake-whaat/">A rundown of the event</a>, the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-10001912-94.html?tag=bl">C|net article</a>, and a more serious <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2008/07/29/socal-earthquake-a-powerful-reminder-of-twitters-potential/">VentureBeat</a> story on the power of flickr.</p>

<p>Let me share the "<a href="http://twitter.com/MissRFTC/statuses/871803775">message</a>" that, stuck er... was so popular to propel the twitterer via a massive viral spread to Internet fame:</p>

I am totally serious. My Ob/Gyn was IN my vagina and an earthquake started rattling the room!

<p>Yes, that one deeply personal update about bad timing at an OB/Gyn put <a href="http://twitter.com/MissRFTC">MissRFTC</a> on the Internet Map.  If only we all could create such a ... compelling message.</p>

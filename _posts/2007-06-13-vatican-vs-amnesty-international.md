The Vatican also said it was suspending all financial aid to Amnesty over what it said was the group's recent change of policy on the issue.

<p>Amnesty said it was not promoting abortion as a universal right.</p>

<p>But the group said that women had a right to choose, particularly in cases of rape or incest.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a> - it provides a steady stream of new and interesting things around the net, and the occasional IT policy tidbit.  <strong>Lots</strong> of people read boingboing as well, giving it a power not unlike the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">slashdot effect</a> - the ability to direct massive amounts of traffic at a site, taking it down in many cases with the onslaught.</p>

<p>Few sites respond with an attitude as user-friendly and pro-sharing as <a href="https://www.gangstagrass.com/">Gangstagrass</a> which is promoting a rap + bluegrass mashup CD:</p>

 HELLO BOING BOING FOLKS - SORRY IF THIS LOADS A LITTLE SLOW, THE SERIES OF TUBES IS A BIT CLOGGED.
CLICK HERE FOR A BIT TORRENT DOWNLOAD OF THE ALBUM!

<p>(If you want the torrent, drop by Gangstagrass for the link).</p>

<p>This is totally backwards from what you'd expect.  You mean the website doesn't want to sign me up for their email spam?  Force me to log in?  Track the number of downloads of their album?  Instead, they're confident enough in their product that good customers will return to their site at some later date to check out what else they have going on -- but in the meantime, they're creating goodwill and advertising by making sure people who were intrigued enough by the BoingBoing article to click were able to get what they were after.  So now I'll listen to it, and if it's good, I'll remember to visit their site again.  If it's not, well, they've not lost anything; I wouldn't be a customer anyway in that situation.</p>

<p>This shouldn't be rocket science, but so rarely do I see people thinking in this pro-user/customer/person way that I thought it'd be nice to give GG a tip of the hat.</p>

<p>Also, this is all a very longwinded way to give thanks to at least one person who's always been very pro-person, at least to me, which is Mom.  Hi Mom!  Happy Mother's Day!  :)</p>

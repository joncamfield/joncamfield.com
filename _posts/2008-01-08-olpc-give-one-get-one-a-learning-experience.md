<p>Over at <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com">OLPCNews</a>, Wayan's written a wrap-up of the <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/g1g1/give_one_get_one_olpc_success.html">Give one, Get one (G1G1) program</a> by the OLPC Foundation to date, and its successes and shortcomings.

<p>In a way, the logistical and support problems of G1G1 will (hopefully?) be a long-term benefit to the project.  Having the fact that the laptop does not automagically inspire creative self-learning in 100% of the cases, and that there are some confusing bugs that require Deep Linux Magic, and that physical distribution is a Hard Problem all sound familiar.  They're are all issues that OLPCNews has pointed out as severely lacking in OLPC's nebulous <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/implementation/plan/">implementation plan</a>.  I hope that the OLPC Foundation will learn from their mistakes (not that they have <a href="http://www.joncamfield.com/blog/2007/07/blasts_from_the_past.html">before</a>), as they move from G1G1 geek early adopters, just about the friendliest, most forgiving, and technically competent crowd around; to government buyers who expect the hype to be real and expect things that they've paid big bucks for to show up on time (or at least on a schedule) with support materials and staff.</p>

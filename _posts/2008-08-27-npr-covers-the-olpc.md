<p>The broadcast touches on the Pacific Island Nation of Niue, which is the first nation to have universal laptop access for all of its students, but as <a href="http://www.betanews.com/article/OLPC_laptops_now_blanket_the_Pacific_nation_of_Niue/1219443165<br />
">BetaNews points out</a>, " that number amounts to only 500."</p>

<p>The story also talks about the pilot in Nepal, which has met with government skepticism, but draws parallels to Nepal's earlier literacy campaign which also drew doubt, but created long-term benefits.</p>

<p>Cyrus Farivar interviews the creator of the laptop computer, <a href="http://www.fonlyinstitute.com/company/staff.php#lf">Lee Felsenstein</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Felsenstein">Wikipedia entry</a>) for his take on the OLPC.  He (rightly) sees its most lasting impact currently as the creation of the <a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/competition/rise_of_4p_computing_solutions.html<br />
">sub-notebook/4PC market in the US</a>.  The creation of this market has potential long-term benefits for development, but so far none of the new entrants have hit on the durability and non-developed-nation utility that the OLPC XO provides (battery life, sun-readable screen, etc.)</p>

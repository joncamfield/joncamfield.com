  Sugar is winning installations after review by education ministries is fantastic:\r\n\r\n-It's
  an important mindshare victory for open source, especially at the operating system
  level (on the computing side) and at the ministry-decision-makers level on the policy
  side. This win will put downstream decisions on software on a more level playing
  field (hopefully?)\r\n\r"

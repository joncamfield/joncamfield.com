  why the sea is boiling hot--\r\nAnd whether pigs have wings.\"</em>\r\n\r\n(From
  of course Lewis Carroll's <u>Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There</u>;

  is a difficult marriage.  You have a room chock full of detail-oriented technologists
  and a crowd of technophile international development/humanitarian aid practicioners
  who have seen both the promise of the \"right\" technology solution and the expensive
  and much more common failures of techno-centric approaches.\r\n\r\nThe HTC has done
  a laudable job in extracting some of the harder problems still haunting development
  which technology can help with - settling on reliable energy, data connectivity
  (particularly for health providers) and patient ID and health records management.\r\n\r\nThe
  breakout session I attended got trapped in definitions, a problem endemic of the
  challenges of shaking engineers and humanitarians together in a jar; very small,
  specific problems getting expanded and divided into  multiple and occasionally more
  general topics with an overwhelming range of potential solutions that may have little
  applicability, either because the technology has been customized or the problem
  misunderstood.\r\n\r\nThe other, more difficult challenge is that the handful of
  largely DC-based humanitarians have to be the voice of the billions who are intended
  to benefit from these technologies.  We need a group of nay-sayers, critics and
  realists constantly poking holes in our ideas.  Kid-powered electrical generators
  for hospitals could reduce child mortality at the cost of early childhood education.\r\n\r\nData
  connectivity and electronic patient ID record management has to be balanced with
  privacy and cultural sensitivity when even going for HIV testing could be a stigma
  attached to violent responses.  Some of these pitfalls we have experience with,
  some we can extrapolate, but an unknowable set of other risks and problems are out
  there, and I worry that solutions we're proposing from the beautiful, air-conditioned,
  wifi-saturated National Academies building sitting between the US National Mall,
  the State Department, and the Kennedy Center in downtown DC will\r\nsimply not be
  rugged enough, will not gracefully degrade, or will miss a key need.\r\n\r\nThat
  all being said; the organizers did a good job with setting the conference up.  The
  speaker selections combined some amazing humanitarian aid / international development
  and activism success stories where technology has played a key roll with high-level
  engineering discussions of the design challenges and goals.\r\n\r\nThe main problem
  I felt was a miscommunication between the people who had been working hard to define
  the problems and the flood of new participants invited to attend the conference
  entering midstream, without the time (or suggestions) to dive through the 15-20
  page documents that had already been compiled; leading to lots of wheel-spinning
  in covering the same definition problems. \r\n\r\nI am hopeful that through the
  various online forums that have been set up to continue, that we will work through
  those initial speedbumps and end up with at least a few good solutions combining
  some engineering know-how, business acumen, and humanitarian/grassroots knowledge.\r\n"

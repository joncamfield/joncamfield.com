<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>There are some LOLPCs hiding away at <a href="http://lolnptech.blogspot.com/search/label/olpc">lolnptech</a>!</p>

<p>I've been very let down by the lack of mashups between OLPC and the LOLcat sillyness.  Why, you already have 2/3rds of the letters <em>in the name</em>.  It can't possibly be any nerdier than <a href="http://lolnptech.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">LOL Non-Profit Technology</a>; with captions such as "Ur nonprofit iz running on 486 PCs and Windoz 95?! No, srsly! Whut r U rly using?"; or <a href="http://lolcode.com/" target="_blank">LOLCode</a>; which turns the traditional LOLCats "captions" into (shudder) executable code, such as this "Hello World" routine:<br />
HAI<br />
CAN HAS STDIO?<br />
VISIBLE "HAI WORLD!"<br />
KTHXBYE</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat" target="_blank">LolCats even have a wikipedia page</a> and an <a href="http://xkcd.com/262/" target="_blank">xkcd comic</a> about them. So I think it can't possibly sink any lower in humor value than the <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/" target="_blank">LOLCat</a> phenomenon already has.  If you don't get it, don't worry -- you're probably better off than the rest of us.  It's basically silly photos of cats with captions explaining what is going through the cat's head at the time.  Cats, evidentially, think in short, poorly-spelled, SMS-like grammar-less tidbits.  Who knew?  

<p>Regardless; I've yet to see any application of this to the OLPC -- what I'll dub; LOLPCs.  So, gentle readers, I present you with the first (evar1!1!eleven) LOLPC collection; and invite you to use any one of the available <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=lolcat+build&btnG=Search">Lolcat creation tools</a> to make more.<br />

<a href="http://www.olpcnews.com/sales_talk/products/" target="_blank"></a><br>Is it can it be free market timez now?This XO seems to be of the opinion that it'd fare better freed of any top-down approach and find its way on the free market (I think it's been reading too much <a href="http://www.nextbillion.net" target="_blank">NextBillion.net</a>)

NOM NOM NOMSaving the best for last, Britt Selvitelle gives us some "awww" factor; but also reveals the real motive: "This actually leads to better wireless reception;" begging the question -- is it one laptop per child ... or one child per laptop???

That's out of my system (for now).</p>

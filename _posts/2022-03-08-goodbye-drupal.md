This is (hopefully!) the last post on my joncamfield.com drupal instance and will be the first on my new jekyll-bases static site. JonCamfield.com started many years ago (almost exactly 16 to be precise -- 2006-03-30T16:30:22Z, according to whois), as I transitioned my online presence from my 90s-era handle to a more professional one.

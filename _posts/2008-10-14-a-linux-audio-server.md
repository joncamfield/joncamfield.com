<p>I admit it.  I have a Windows laptop at home.  For a very long time, it was my primary system.</p>

<p>For the past year or so, I've been using a Linux laptop as my daily system, reverting to the Windows system for reliable video and HD audio -- basically, it was my media system, which just happened to also have all my email, files, and whatnot.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://audreyandjon.com/">moving in with my girlfriend</a> (who's an ardent Mac user), we've been trying to find a neutral solution to our media needs.  I refuse to use iTunes, but am so far not very happy with XMMS / AmaroK on Linux.  Frankly, I like Winamp.  It has amazing capabilities, a good Media Library with search/filtering (and complex boolean logic) for automatic playlists, it's fully supoprted by my remote control, and with <a href="http://www.flippet.org/wawi/">WAWI</a> I can control it over the Internets too.  Plus, it's easy to set it up to stream to one or more ice/shoutcast servers and rebroadcast that over the LAN or the Internet.</p>

<p>It shouldn't be ... that hard to recreate this on a Linux box.  Right?</p>

<p>I have two pretty low-power boxes available - an AMD PIC that I'm in the process of putting a DamnSmallLinux on, and my workhorse Dell Latitude that I bought at a dot-com assets auction.  It's been with me to Venezuela and Jamaica, and is celebrating it's 10th birthday this year.  It has Ubuntu on it with a clean gnome desktop, but KDE extentions installed to support amaroK.  I'd reinstall the whole thing, but the sound config is a dark art that took me weeks and lots of luck last time I got it working (and I'm all out of candles).</p>

<p>So the laptop system is currently "working," but it's pretty painfully slow and has some odd problems - the playlist likes to randomize itself from my library after a while, the audio volume (in the system) likes to lower itself, and remote connections to the GUI have been, thus far, unsuccessful.  I haven't even tried getting the interactive Amarok web interface to work decently or LIRC to talk to my USB/IR/remote.</p>

<p>I'm sure it's all possible.  I'd just occasionally like it to also be easy (without my gf constantly trying to pull me over to the Dark Side.</p>

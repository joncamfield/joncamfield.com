So, I've been beating <a href="https://joncamfield.com/blog/2011.05/celebrating-world-press">this drum</a> <a href="https://joncamfield.com/blog/2009.05/after-the-sms-honeymoon.html">for a while</a> - oppressive governments are increasingly quick and intelligent in responding to protests that use mobile and new media to organize and get the word out.  So, join us in July (https://www.meetup.com/intlrel-76/events/23103221/) to hear from an amazing panel and discuss the next steps in this cat and mouse game:

<blockquote><p>The Twitter Revolution. &nbsp;The Cellphone Revolution. &nbsp;The Facebook Revolution. &nbsp;While the "Arab Spring" uprisings succeed based on real-world organizing, protests and democracy-building, it's no secret that mobiles and social media provided tools to broadcast, coordinate and amplify these movements. &nbsp;Oppressive governments are responding both faster and smarter to these digital tools.</p>
<p>Please join our panel of experts discussing the role of online activism going forward. &nbsp;What are&nbsp;the next steps in information empowerment in a more hostile environment for online activism? &nbsp;What is the role of mobile and new media in affecting change in government, and what are the risks?</p>
<p>We will begin with a discussion by the panelists, then move into an open question and answer session. &nbsp;Afterwards, we'll transition to a happy hour at Circle Bistro.</p>
<p>This meet-up is co-hosted by <a href="https://www.irex.org/">IREX</a> and <a href="https://www.appropriateit.org/">Appropriate IT</a>.</p>

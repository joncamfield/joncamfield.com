<p>It has a similar form-factor weighing 1.5lbs, comes with wireless (and bluetooth!), a webcam, and a solid 5.5 hour battery life.  It also includes an ethernet port and a 40GB hard drive (not solid state, unfortunately).  The worst part about it is naturally that it includes Vista and Office, and comes in at a $1000 (give or take, depending on the version of Vista/Office) price tag.  OK, XP Tablet Edition is an option -- for an additional $100 (huh?).  On the other hand, once you get rid of your MS installation,  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmFPYlqvHWs">Ubuntu with Compiz Fusion</a> runs on it smoothly.</p>

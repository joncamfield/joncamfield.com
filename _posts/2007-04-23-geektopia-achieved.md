  and it is capable of establishing direct contact between you and their producers.
  Like you, the fridge is on the Internet and thus able to get hold of you â€“ even
  on your mobile. It will let you know what you need to buy if you want to prepare
  a simmering beef stroganoff; also, it will alert you if you are out of chocolate-and-fruit
  flavoured ice cream.</blockquote> \r\n\r\n<blockquote>But this is as much about
  security! In case a food producer detects a potential health hazard in a shipment,
  he can -- via the fridge -- send out a warning and withdraw the product in question.
  </blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Version 2.0 of the refrigerator has thus been equipped
  with a reader on its top shelf -- a reader capable of transmitting in a higher frequency
  to the RFID tags appended to the foodstuff.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The
  resonance frequency occurring in the reader on the shelf will build up a tension
  high enough to transmit a response back to the antenna and â€“ as compared with
  the 14 centimetres of version 1.0 â€“ the signal now has a range of 22 centimetres.

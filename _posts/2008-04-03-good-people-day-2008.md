  good people day idea</a> all about giving props where due.  Since I'll be nose-down
  in work preparing for the upcoming <a href="https://www.ysa.org/gysd" target="_blank">Global
  Youth Service Day</a> April 25-28, let me point out the amazing youth around the
  world who do the real work on GYSD as some people who rock.  Last year we had over
  three million youth in over 100 countries taking up projects to improve their community
  -- and expect the same or more this year.</p>

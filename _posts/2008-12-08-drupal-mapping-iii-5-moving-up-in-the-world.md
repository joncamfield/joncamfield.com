  Mapping project</a>, and that's partially because I've been spending some time getting
  a great site that aggregates and re-publishes news for the volunteer service world
  together at <a href=\"https://www.servicewire.org\">ServiceWire.org</a> using Drupal
  6, FeedAPI, Views, and some other fun tricks - you can follow it on Twitter at <a
  href=\"https://www.twitter.com/ServiceWire\">@ServiceWire</a> - it posts about once
  an hour or so with news about volunteer service and service-learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyhow,
  my experience working with D6 and the newest Views module have convinced me that
  as long as most of the tools I need for the map are available on D6, it's time to
  move.  So I'm rebuilding from scratch (bad luck with upgrades of recent, and I'd
  like to apply and cement my recently gained knowledge).  Unfortunately, the Node_import
  module - key to a lot of the testing I want to do on the map and views - is not
  quite ready, so I'm waiting for that to release an update that works with Location
  and CCK, and in a holding pattern until then.</p>\r\n"

<p>I just don't like doing things the right way, OK?  The right way is boring.  You don't learn anything.  It's... it's just too easy.  So I refuse to use iTunes with my new iPod shuffle (a Chronicka gift) (Chronicka is my new Christmas-Hanukkah <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">Portmanteau</a>).  I also dislike iTunes' harsh treatment of my carefully named and organized files (I have a huge "electronica" directory -- in a perfect world, my music would all have quality idv3 tags and I wouldn't need that, but seriously).</p>

<p>So I'm using gtkpod on Linux and winamp on Windows.  gtkpod works perfectly, but doesn't seem to automatically transcode my ogg files (not that winamp is doing that well, but I think once I get the LAME mp3 encoder working it should be better), and while it manages the Shuffle's playlist correctly, the interface is a bit kludgy for moving whole groups of songs around on the playlist.  Even with multi-select, it only moves one song at a time.</p>

<p>So back to Winamp, both for my larger media collection (though that's transferable, at least temporarily, using my external HDD), as well as for a slightly less grumpy interface.</p>

<p>Winamp's built-in portable media plugin, however, is limited in what it can do.  I mean, it's powerful, has an autofill based on playcounts/ratings, syncing, and so on .... but it can't create a customized playlist order -- everything goes in in alphabetical order by file name.  Uh.... Not ideal at all.</p>

<p>Replacing the built-in iPod support with <a href="https://mlipod.sourceforge.net/">ml_ipod</a>, an open source, higher-functionality version, basically just fixes this.</p>

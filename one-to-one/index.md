## Calculating the Total Cost of Operation for 1:1 computing projects

I have been privileged to work with Roxanna Bassi on her most
recent tool for GeSCI  (Global e-School and
Communities Initiative, <a
href="http://www.gesci.org">http://www.gesci.org</a>)
to  create some financial guidance towards Ministry officials considering a
1:1 computing education project, such as the One Laptop Per Child
concept.

Roxana is an Information Systems Engineer that has worked in ICT for
development for 20 years. She currently advises Ministries of Education
on ICT4E issues as ICT Specialist for GeSCI.

<!--GeSCI provides strategic advice to Ministries of Education in
developing countries on the effective use of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs) for education and communities of
learning. Adopting a demand driven, collaborative and comprehensive
approach, we aim to improve the quality of teaching and learning through
the strategic and effective use of ICTs, thereby transforming education,
empowering communities and promoting development.-->

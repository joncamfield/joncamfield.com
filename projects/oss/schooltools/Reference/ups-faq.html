TOPIC:	What is this document all about?</h2>

<h3><a name="0101">01.01</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	What is this document?
<p>
A:	This is a FAQ document on Uninterruptible Power Supplies.  It is 
intended to provide a starting point for those people that want 
to find out what they are, what they do, and what's available.

<p>
Note that most of this document is very US-centric.  The power
numbers, companies and services all emphasize US consumer 
needs.  Sorry, but that's what I have to work with.  All the
principles discussed here should be applicable just about 
everywhere.

<h3><a name="0102">01.02</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How is this document made available?
<p>
A:	Currently, this document is available on the World Wide Web.
It is referenced with most major search engines.  It used to be
posted to the following Usenet newsgroups: <tt>comp.misc, comp.unix.admin, 
comp.sys.sun.hardware, comp.sys.hp.hardware, comp.sys.sgi.hardware, 
comp.sys.next.hardware, comp.sys.ibm.hardware, comp.sys.dec, 
comp.answers</tt>, and <tt>news.answers</tt>.  
This hasn't been done in years.  Should it be?  
If I post it to every group where UPS questions get asked, that
would be a lot of groups.  I'm open to suggestions.

<p>
This document itself is available via the World Wide Web at:
<a href="http://www.jetcafe.org/~npc/doc/ups-faq.html">
<tt>http://www.jetcafe.org/~npc/doc/ups-faq.html</tt></a>.  

<h3><a name="0103">01.03</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Who maintains this?
<p>
A:	Right now, this document is maintained by Nick Christenson.  My
preferred email address is 
<a href="mailto:npc@jetcafe.org?UPS FAQ"><tt>npc@jetcafe.org</tt></a>, 
and I would like 
it very much if questions regarding this document could have 
the word "UPS" or "UPS FAQ" or some such in the Subject line.  
Note:  I am maintaining this on my own time, so please don't 
be upset if it takes a while for me to respond to your queries.  
Also none of the information in here represents the views or has 
the blessing of any organization whatsoever.  The maintainer of 
the FAQ is to be held solely responsible for its contents.

<p>
I've taken a bit of a hiatus from maintaining this as I switched
jobs and been very busy.  I hope to keep it more up to date in
the future.  Similarly, the document is going through considerable
flux right now.  I'm receptive to any suggestions.

<h3><a name="0104">01.04</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Where did this information come from?
<p>
A:	Thankfully, many people have rallied to my cry to fill in
the many gaps in my original draft.  This is now a group work,
although I claim full responsibility for misstatements and 
inaccuracies.  
	
<h3><a name="0105">01.05</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How can I contribute?
<p>
A:	You should mail new information, corrections, suggestions, etc.
to the current maintainer of this FAQ.  If you provide a suggestion,
make sure you reference where the information is located in the
document.  I guarantee that suggestions of the form "Change the
word 'always' to 'almost always' in the part about surge suppression."
will be ignored.

<h3><a name="0106">01.06</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Are there any restrictions on distribution of this document?
<p>
A:	This document is copyright by the author.  You are encouraged

as long as the contents remain unchanged and a pointer to 
an up-to-date version is included.

<h3><a name="0107">01.07</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Got anything else you'd like to add?
<p>
A:	Yes, now that you mention it.  The people who contribute to this
document can speak only about equipment they have experience with.
This may reflect a bias toward or against certain brands, features,
functions, etc..  Please keep in mind that the suggestions, brand
names and functions here are by no means exhaustive, or even 
necessarily applicable to your situation.  Also, if you have 
information that is not in this document, please submit it to 
the maintainer listed above.  If you submit information, please
say whether you'd like it to be attributed to you or not.  I am 
more than glad to give credit to the fine people who helped with
this document, but I want to respect the anonymity of those 
people who would prefer it.

<p>
One more caveat:  While the principles of UPS design and 
maintenance are likely to be fairly universal, the power 
figures in this FAQ are <em>very</em> US-centric.  Sorry, but 
they're the only numbers I have.

<h3><a name="0108">01.08</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Glossary
<p>
A:	This was contributed almost entirely by some kind soul.  I just
cleaned it up a bit.

<dl>
<dt>Blackout 
<dd>Complete loss of power. Some literature considers a voltage
drop below about 80V to be a blackout as well since most
equipment will not operate below these levels.

<dt>Sag or Brownout
<dd>Decrease in voltage levels which can last for
periods ranging from fractions of a second to hours. Can be
caused by heavy equipment coming on line such as shop tools,
elevators, compressors etc. Also occurs when utility companies
deliberately do this to cope with peak load times.

<dt>Spike
<dd>An instantaneous and tremendous increase in voltage often
caused by a direct lightning strike on a power line or when
power returns after a blackout.

<dt>Surge
<dd>An substantial increase in voltage lasting a small fraction
of a second, often caused when high powered appliances such as
air conditioners are switched off.

<dt>EMI/RFI Noise
<dd>ElectroMagnetic Interference and Radio Frequency
Interference. Caused by, inter alia, lightning, generators,
radio transmitters, industrial equipment.

<dt>MOV
<dd>Metal Oxide Varistors used to control spikes.  These are
common in Power Strips.  If you see more than two, you likely
have a fairly decent Power Strip.  They look like largish disk
capacitors.

<dt>Inverter
<dd>Circuitry that converts DC battery power to AC power
required by most computer equipment.

<dt>Surge Protector
<dd>Circuitry consisting of MOVs, capacitors, rod-core
inductors etc. for suppressing surges and spikes usually embedded
in a power strip.

<dt>Line Conditioner
<dd>A transformer that attempts to smooth out
fluctuations in input voltage to provide near uniform output
voltage or voltage waveform.

<h2><a name="02">02:</a><br>
TOPIC:  What is a UPS and how does is work?</h2>

<h3><a name="0201">02.01</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	What is a UPS?
<p>
A:	An Uninterruptible Power Supply is a device that sits between
a power supply (e.g. a wall outlet) and a device (e.g. a computer)
to prevent undesired features of the power source (outages, sags,
surges, bad harmonics, etc.) from the supply from adversely 
affecting the performance of the device.  

<h3><a name="0202">02.02</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How do you pronounce "UPS"?
<p>
A:	I pronounce it "ups", but most of the literature seems to favor
"you pee ess", since they use "a UPS" instead of "an UPS".  This
document will try to follow the literature.

<h3><a name="0203">02.03</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Vendor X says that (fill in description) is a UPS, but it's 
different that what you describe above.  Who's right?
<p>
A:	There really is no standard definition of what a UPS is.  
Anything ranging from a 9 volt battery backup in a clock radio
to a building/compound wide backup generator has been called
a UPS by someone.  The majority of this document refers to
objects larger than a beer can and smaller than a desk that
help devices remain temporarily operational when changes to the 
power they receive would otherwise interrupt their function.

<p>
Maintaining power to a minicomputer (like a VAX 11) is beyond
the scope of this document.  This FAQ deals with UPS equipment 
that can be installed by a computer owner/administrator.  If you 
have requirements that large, you need to talk to a qualified 
electrician.

<h3><a name="0204">02.04</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Can you give me some more information on this?
<p>
A:	(Kindly provided by Don Deal, <tt>Don.Deal@oit.gatech.edu</tt>, my 
additions are in [square brackets].)

<p>
The UPS industry is made up of many manufacturers, and there is 
a lack of standard terms within the industry.  I think this 
sometimes borders on deliberate misdirection. (It's a jungle out 
there!)  [ Note, in recent years the whole industry seems to 
have gotten better, at least mostly agreeing on what the terms 
listed here mean.  This is not true everywhere, but things are 
getting better. ]

<p>
There are basically three different types of devices, all of 
which are occasionally passed off as UPSs.

<ol>
<li>Standby power supply (SPS). In this type of supply, power is 
usually derived directly from the power line, until power fails. 
After power failure, a battery powered inverter turns on to 
continue supplying power.  Batteries are charged, as necessary, 
when line power is available.  This type of supply is sometimes 
called an "offline" UPS.

<p>
The quality and effectiveness of this class of devices varies 
considerably; however, they are generally quite a bit cheaper than
"true" UPSs.  The time required for the inverter to come on line,
typically called the switchover time, varies by unit.  While some
computers may be able to tolerate long switchover times, your
mileage may vary.  [ Some articles in the trade press have claimed
that their testing shows that modern PCs can withstand transfer
times of 100ms or more.  Most UPS units claim a transfer time to 
battery of about 4ms.  Note that even if a computer can stay up
for 100ms, it doesn't mean that 100ms switchover is okay.  Damage
can still be done to a computer or data on it even if it stays
up. ]

<p>
Other features to look for in this class of supplies is line 
filtering and/or other line conditioners. Since appliances 
connected to the supply are basically connected directly from 
the power line, SPSs provide relatively poor protection from 
line noise, frequency variations, line spikes, and brownouts. 

<p>
[Some SPS's claim to have surge/spike suppression circuitry as 
well as transformers to "boost" voltage without switching to 
the battery if a modest voltage drop occurs. An example is the 
"APC Smart UPS" which claims it will switch to this boosting mode 
if voltage drops below 103V (from the normal expected 120V) and 
switches to battery only at 90V and below.  This, it is claimed, 
allows operation of the equipment indefinitely under brownout 
conditions as long as voltage does not drop below 90V.  I have
not tested this, and would be interested in independent data.  
There are other vendors products that make similar claims.]

<p>
<li>Hybrid [ or ferroresonant] UPS systems. I only know one vendor 
who sells them - 
Best Power, Inc. The theory behind these devices is fairly simple. 
When normal operating line power is present, the supply conditions 
power using a ferroresonant transformer. This transformer maintains 
a constant output voltage even with a varying input voltage and 
provides good protection against line noise.  The transformer also 
maintains output on its secondary briefly when a total outage occurs.  
Best claims that their inverter then goes on line so quickly that 
it is operating without any interruption in power.  Other UPS 
vendors maintain that the transition is less than seamless, but 
then again it's not in their best interest to promote Best's products.  
Best has a sizable part of the UPS market.

<p>
[ Note:  According to some sources, ferroresonant transformers in an
UPS system can interact with ferroresonant transformers in your 
equipment and produce unexpected results.  On the other hand, 
ferroresonant UPS systems don't kick off a lot of heat, which is 
important in some environments.  The Moral:  Again, test before you 
buy.  -npc ]

<p>
<li>What I call "true" UPS systems, those supplies that continuously 
operate from an inverter. Obviously, there is no switchover time, 
and these supplies generally provide the best isolation from power 
line problems.  The disadvantages to these devices are increased 
cost, increased power consumption, and increased heat generation.  
Despite the fact that the inverter in a "true" UPS is always on, 
the reliability of such units does not seem to be affected.  In 
fact, we have seen more failures in cheaper SPS units.  [ Note,
though, that given the same quality inverter, you'd expect the
one that runs least to last longest. ]
</ol>

<h3><a name="0205">02.05</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How can it help me?
<p>
A:	A UPS has internal batteries to guarantee that continuous power
is provided to the equipment even if the power supply stops
providing power.  Of course the UPS can provide power for a while,
typically a few minutes, but that is often enough to ride out
power company glitches or short outages.  
Advantages:
<ol>
<li>Computer jobs don't stop because the power fails.
<li>Users not inconvenienced by computer shutting down.
<li>Equipment does not incur the stress of another (hard) power cycle.
<li>Data isn't lost because a machine shut down without doing a "sync" or 
equivalent to flush cached or real time data.
</ol>

<h3><a name="0206">02.06</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	What sort of stuff does a UPS do?
<p>
A:	A UPS traditionally can perform the following functions:
<ol>
<li>Absorb relatively small power surges.
<li>Smooth out noisy power sources.
<li>Continue to provide power to equipment during line sags.
<li>Provide power for some time after a blackout has occurred.
</ol>
In addition, some UPS or UPS/software combinations provide the
following functions:
<ol>
<li>Automatic shutdown of equipment during long power outages.
<li>Monitoring and logging of the status of the power supply.
<li>Display the Voltage/Current draw of the equipment.
<li>Restart equipment after a long power outage.
<li>Display the voltage currently on the line.
<li>Provide alarms on certain error conditions.
<li>Provide short circuit protection.
</ol>

<h3><a name="0207">02.07</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How long can equipment on a UPS keep running after the power
goes?
<p>
A:	How big a UPS do you have and what kind of equipment does it 
protect?  For most typical computer workstations, one might 
have a UPS that was rated to keep the machine alive through 
a 15 minute power loss.  If you need a machine to survive 
hours without power should probably look at a more robust
power backup solution.  Even if a UPS has a very small load,
it must still operate it's DC (battery) to AC converter, 
which costs power.  A rough extrapolation from APC's 
documentation, leads me to guess that a 2000 VA UPS can
operate it's own converter (with no extra load) for just
over 8 hours.  A 1250 VA UPS could run its converter for 
about 5.  These are *very* rough guesses based on information
provided by one vendor for one vendor.

<h3><a name="0208">02.08</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Given the same vendor claims, how can I tell a "good" quality
UPS from a "poor" quality UPS?
<p>
A:	Testing, testing, testing.  I can't emphasize this enough.  There
are many good and bad units out there that call themselves UPS's.
There are many good units that are wrong for your situation.
Caveat Emptor.

<p>
	Some properties you might look for are:
<ol>
<li>Sinusoidal power output.  In general, the closer the AC output 
of the UPS is to a sine wave, the better it is for your equipment.  
Many UPS units, especially the cheaper ones, deviate a great
deal from a sinusoidal output.  Some of them generate square
waves.  Waveform effects are dealt with in section 2.12.
<li>Does the UPS have a manual bypass switch?  If the UPS is 
broken or is being serviced, can you pass power through it to 
your equipment?  The last thing you want is for a broken UPS to 
be the cause of extra downtime.
<li>The more information about a UPS's operation you can get from
watching the unit itself, the better.  How much power (or 
percentage load) the equipment is drawing, how much battery
life is left and indications of the input power quality are
all very useful.
<li>Some newer UPS's can communicate with their monitoring software 
via network connection and SNMP!  This is wonderful *if* your 
network is on a UPS!  Also, beware, I have heard of dealers
advertising "Network UPS" monitoring where the network is 
the normal serial connection (no SLIP or PPP).  
<li>Does the UPS vendor offer support/maintenance contracts.  If
don't even offer them, I would suspect the quality of the
equipment.
</ol>

<p>
If you do have a UPS that does not output a sinusoidal waveform,
some manufacturers *strongly* urge you to not put a surge protector
between the UPS and the computer.  The surge protector might mistake
the non-sine waveform as a power surge and try to send it to ground.
This could be bad for your UPS.  I don't know if this has happened
or not, but I wouldn't chance it.

<h3><a name="0209">02.09</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Should I make sure I have a support/maintenance contract for my
UPS systems?
<p>
A:	Some people strongly recommend this, but to be honest, I don't 
know how important it is.  I haven't had any UPS's long enough
to have enough of them fail to know what the failure modes are
likely to be.  Some people, with more experience than I in these
matters, insist that a UPS support/maintenance contract is as
important as your computer support/maintenance contract.  I can't
argue with them.  In any case, it's almost certainly worth 
pricing at any rate.

<h3><a name="0210">02.10</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	What sort of maintenance can I perform myself?
<p>
A:	One good thing you might want to do is periodically test the 
UPS's and their failure modes.  A good time to do this might be 
right after after a periodic level 0 backup.  Nobody is logged 
in and you've got full backups of the machines.  Throw the 
circuit breaker with the UPS on it to simulate and outage and 
see how the transition goes.  Note that some UPS vendors suggest
that testing an UPS by pulling the plug from the wall is *not*
a good idea (Tripp Lite is one of them).  These UPS units like
to have a good idea of what ground looks like.  It is likely that
unplugging just about any UPS for a short amount of time would
not be too dangerous (don't take my word for it, though!), but
in all cases, throwing a circuit breaker would be a better thing
to do. 

<p>
It might be useful to install a GFI (Ground Fault Interrupter)
socket to facilitate this testing without having to pull the plug,
especially if you don't have your UPS protected machines on
an isolated circuit (which you probably should).  These are the 
sockets found in most modern kitchens and bathrooms with a red 
and a black button. You push the latter to cut power and the 
former to restore power.

<p>
Those UPS units that use lead-acid batteries (that's most of 
them, I'm told) do not have a battery memory and should be run 
dry as few times as possible.  It's probably not a bad investment 
to do this once on one UPS out of a largish batch to learn how 
much UPS time you can expect in a real power outage.  Note:  
depending on the manufacturer, UPS batters can be expected to 
last between about 1 and 5 years before they ought to be replaced.

<p>
As a UPS gets older, its battery life will become shorter.  Of
course there's no way to reliably test how long it is without
running the battery down and you don't want to do that because
they have lead acid batteries.  &#60;Sigh.&#62;  All of these are very
good reasons to get a support contract for them that includes
periodic battery replacement.  At the very least, you can figure
that the batteries will still be good at the end of the UPS 
warranty figure, so that's a good place to start guesswork.
	
<h3><a name="0211">02.11</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Isn't a UPS just a glorified power strip/surge protector with
some batteries and a little power conditioning thrown in?
<p>
A:	Basically.  It's also got a power inverter and some other circuitry.
It may also have a timer, thermometer or other gadgets.

<h3><a name="0212">02.12</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How important is the UPS output waveform?
<p>
A:	That's a good question, and one is worthy of some debate.  One
school of thought holds that one should always run equipment on
the best approximation of sinusoidal input that one can, and that
deviations produce harmonics which may either be interpreted as
signal if they get through a power supply, or may actually damage
the equipment.  Another school holds that since almost all 
computers use switching-type power supplies, which only draw 
power at or near the peaks of the waveforms, the shape of the 
input power waveform is not important.  Who's right?  I don't 
know.  My <em>opinion</em> is that sinusoidal output is worth the 
extra money, especially for on-line UPS systems that continually
provide their waveform to the computer.  Also, if you don't *know*
that your equipment has a switching-type power supply, you might
want to think twice before buying a low quality UPS.

TOPIC:	UPS monitoring/shutdown software.</h2>

<h3><a name="0301">03.01</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	If the power is out for a long time, I would like to have my
computer automatically shut itself down gracefully before the
UPS batteries die.  Can I do this?
<p>
A:	Yes.  Most UPS manufacturers support software that will do this 
for some UPS's on at least some platforms.  Ask your UPS vendor 
for details.
<p>
Q:	Okay, how about restarting the system for me once power returns?
<p>
A:	Fewer software products do this, but many do.  Again, ask your
vendor.  I do not know of any freely distributable products that
will do this.  It doesn't mean that they can't be built, but 
vendor software is cheap enough (usually) that it's probably not
worth building.

<h3><a name="0302">03.02</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How does it work?  I'm a starving (fill in the blank) and I really 
don't want to pay for software unless I absolutely have to.
<p>
A:	Usually, there is a serial connection running from a UPS into
your computer.  The UPS sends information along the serial line
as it goes.  If you can decode which pins contain which information,
how the information is formatted and figure out what it wants to
hear from the computer side, you're all set.  Make sure you have
the right serial cable and know how the pins map between DB9 and 
DB25 as both your computer and your UPS may take either.

<p>
Since UPS units with network based monitoring capabilities are
appearing on the market, we can hopefully get something that will
communicate with those units.

<p>
Here is a skeleton script provided by Joe Moss, 
<tt>joe@morton.rain.com</tt>.  Definitely check this out as a 
starting point, but don't expect it to do anything meaningful 
without some work.


<pre>
        #! /bin/sh

        # Shut down system in case of extended power failure

        # This should be the serial port to which the UPS is connected
        # This port must be set to block on open until the DCD line
        # is asserted - many UNIX systems have this determined by

<p>
Q:	Hmmm... that sounds kinda complicated.  Has someone already done
this?
<p>
A:	Any solution would almost certainly be vendor specific.  However,
some brave souls have provided partial functionality for certain
vendors' UPS's.  I don't know the original source, but I have a
copy available for anonymous FTP at navigator.jpl.nasa.gov in
the pub/src/UPS directory as upsd.tar.Z.  I haven't tried it and 
I don't honestly know if it even works.  

<p>
Note:  Different UPS's produce different sorts of signals.  Just
installing this already built package may require a great deal of
work.  The cabling can be complicated, etc..  I would be 
interested in hearing where this software does/doesn't work.

<p>
Another good example, that probably works straight away for
SunOS 4.1.X machines using APC Back-UPS devices, is also 
available on navigator for anonymous FTP in the pub/src/UPS
directory is pf.c.  It was written by Ronald Florence 
(<tt>ron@mlfarm.com</tt>).  It looks like a nice framework for expansion
to other OS platforms and UPS implementations.  Give it a try.

<p>
Q:	I can't find monitoring software that will work on my configuration.
What should I do?
<p>
A:	Well, it seems you have a few choices:
<ol>
<li>Build your own.  See item 03.02.
<li>Use something freely distributable.  See item 03.03.
<li>Lean on your UPS vendor to port to your platform.
<li>Try a different vendor that supports your platform.  See item 05.01.
</ol>

<h3><a name="0305">03.05</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	What other software is out there?
<p>
A:	Software packages for UPS machines are getting more sophisticated.
Most provide some level of power and status monitoring, but 
lately there are more GUI's, more interactive packages, SNMP
support, and even call-out paging.  See the software section
05.03 for more info.


<h2><a name="04">04:</a><br>
TOPIC:	How big a UPS do I need?</h2>

<h3><a name="0401">04.01</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How are the "sizes" of UPS's determined?
<p>
A:	Typically, a UPS has a VA rating.  The VA rating is the maximum
number of Volts * Amps it can deliver.  The VA rating is not the 
same as the power drain (in Watts) of the equipment.  Computers
are notoriously non-resistive.  A typical PF (power factor: 
Watts/VA) for workstations may be as low as 0.6, which means that
if you record a drain of 100 Watts, you need a UPS with a VA
rating of 167.  Some literature suggests that 0.7 may be a 
good conversion factor, but this will depend heavily on the 
machine.  WARNING:  Don't take my word for it!  Note:  Some UPS's 
can continue to deliver power if the VA rating is exceeded, they 
merely can't provide above their VA rating if the power goes.  
Some can't provide power above their VA rating at all.  Some may 
do something really nasty if you try.  In any case, I <em>strongly</em>
recommend not doing this under <em>any</em> circumstances.

<h3><a name="0402">04.02</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How can I tell what VA rating I need for my equipment?
<p>
A:	First, when possible, get VA rather than wattage ratings.  See
Q04.01 above.
There are a couple of ways:
<ol>
<li>Direct measurement.  You can get equipment to measure
the current draw of your equipment directly.  You may
or may not have access to this.  If you are part of an
organization that has it's own facilities/electrical
type people, they're likely to be able to do this.  They
might help you out if you ask nice.
<li>Compare notes.  If you know someone with the same setup
you're using, ask them what they use and how close they
are to the maximum VA rating.
<li>Use a chart.  Most vendors can help you out for common
equipment.  If you have an unusual setup, or mix 
vendors a lot, you're probably out of luck here.
<li>Use the equipment rating.  Most pieces of computer
equipment have a power rating on some back panel.  This
number is usually high, as it is necessary for the 
manufacturer to play it safe or they'll get sued.
</ol>

<p>
Note:  Method 1 is by far the best, method 2 and 3 are secondary,
method 4 is usually overkill, but pretty safe.  There are some
examples in section 4.6, but the information is probably worth
what you paid for it :-)

<h3><a name="0403">04.03</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	Hmmm... seems like a tough thing to determine.
<p>
A:	Yeah, it can be.  It's also very important.  If you get a UPS 
that's too big, then you've overpaid, but your equipment can 
survive a longer outage.  If you get a UPS that's too small, 
then you could be in deep trouble.  Therefore, I recommend that 
you be conservative in buying these things, unfortunately, this 
costs money.

<h3><a name="0404">04.04</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	What else should I consider?
<p>
A:	It would be nice to know how long your site's typical power 
outages are.  In some places, with nice weather and a flaky
power grid, the power is almost never out for more than 5 minutes,
but this could happen quite frequently.  In this case, you may 
as well use a UPS with a VA rating close to your equipment 
rating with no extra batteries.  If your area has longer outages, 
in the half hour or hour range, as is often the case in 
thunderstorm country, you can either buy UPS's with multiples 
of the VA rating of the equipment, since oversizing a VA rating 
for a UPS has the effect of lengthening the amount of time your 
equipment can stay up in case of a power outage, or you can buy 
additional battery units for a smaller UPS.  You can probably 
get away with doing simple math to determine how much longer a 
larger UPS will keep your equipment running, but I recommend 
running a few tests before committing to a large purchase 
order.  Also, your UPS vendor will almost certainly be glad 
to help you size the equipment you need.  If all else fails 
and you guess wrong, or move equipment to a location with 
different power status, you may be really, really glad if you 
bought a UPS that can have additional battery packs added.
	
<h3><a name="0405">04.05</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	How about I use one of these UPS thingies for a laser printer?
<p>
A:	Don't <em>ever</em> do this.  If you ever measured the current draw
of a laser printer during startup (and during printing) you'd
be stunned at what it pulls.  All UPS manufacturers I know of
tell you not to do this.

<p>
Okay, I have to back down from this.  I know APC, just as an 
example, now does rate some of their UPS units for use with 
certain laser printers.  Not that I think this is a good
idea, mind you.  In general, they are difficult to size and 
rarely do they require the same level of uptime as servers.

<p>
In any case, don't do this without specific approval of
your UPS vendor.

<h3><a name="0406">04.06</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	So, what sorts of UPS sizes do you use on your equipment?
<p>
A:	BIG DISCLAIMER.  I disclaim everything about these figures.  
At best, they are very, very rough.  Heck, I may be lying.  
Don't trust them.  Here they are anyway.

<p>
Note also, this is what the equipment apparently PULLS, not
the UPS sizes that are on them.  Generally, I've been using
UPS's that are about 2X the VA ratings shown.  At the very
least, I would using UPS sized 1.5X the VA ratings here.

<dl>
<dt>400 VA:
<dd>Sparc 2 with 3 600 MB disks, 1 200 MB disk, 1 exabyte 8200 
tape drive, 19" color monitor.
<dt>600 VA:
<dd>HP 750 with 4 1.3 GB disks, internal 4mm tape drive and internal
CD-ROM drive, external disk cabinet and 19" color monitor.
<dt>500 VA:
<dd>SPARC 2GX clone.  1 1.2 GB disk, 4 2.0 GB disks, 2 tape drives,
1 CD-ROM drive, "big" monitor.
<dt>300 VA:
<dd>Sparc 2 clone with 100W power supply, internal 424 disk, 16"
color monitor, external 1 GB disk drive.
</dl>
<p>
These are U.K. numbers, based on 240 V wall current.  Most of
these VA numbers are very close to "American" VA numbers, but
if my caveats weren't strong enough earlier... .
<dl>
<dt>100 VA:
<dd>SGI Indigo R4400, 48 MB RAM, 1 GB int. disk, no graphics, no 
monitor.
<dt>580 VA:
<dd>SGI Indigo R4400 configured as above with 17" Sony monitor plus
3 19" monochrome X terminals.
</dl>
	
<p>
Another word of warning, don't assume that power requirements
scale with compute power and number of peripherals, ESPECIALLY
if they are different architectures.  Older equipment, CPU's,
disks, monitors, whatever almost universally requires more
power than new equipment.  For example, it seems that an HP
9000/425e with 1 internal 420 MB disk and 19" color monitor 
pulls a lot more power than a much more modern and much faster
HP 9000/715 with an internal 1.3 GB disk, CD-ROM drive and 
more modern 19" color monitor.  Again, the moral is don't assume.

TOPIC:	Specific manufacturer's information.</h2>

<h3><a name="0501">05.01</a></h3>
<p>
Q:	What vendors are there and what do they produce?
<p>
A:	Here is a very incomplete list, based only on what I know.
Please give me information to expand it.  I make no claims
as to the accuracy of this information.  It is mostly based
on personal recommendations and vendor propaganda.

<p>
Note:  The October 1994 issue of LAN Magazine has a great
vendor list.  I have used it to update many of the entries
here.  However, there is a lot of information available
there that I don't have space to include here.  This 
article is an excellent starting point for comparative pricing
on UPS equipment.

<h3><a name="0502">05.02</a>	UPS Hardware (and software) manufacturers:</h3>

<p>
In earlier versions of this document, I gave contact information and 
a brief (usually a bit out of date) product listing of all the major
UPS vendors I could find.  Now, with nearly all of this information on
line, it makes more sense just to provide a link to the web pages of
the companies and list what sort of general market they're in.  I think
this is actually more useful and is certainly less likely to drift out
of date.  Note, I'm including information only on manufacturers, not 
retailers.

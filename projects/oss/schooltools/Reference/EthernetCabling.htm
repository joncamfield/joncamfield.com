<p>The information listed here is to assist Network Administrators in the color 
  coding of Ethernet cables. Please be aware that modifying Ethernet cables improperly 
  may cause loss of network connectivity. Use this information at your own risk, 
  and insure all connectors and cables are modified in accordance with standards.

<p>The T-568A standard is supposed to be used in new network installations. Most 
  off-the-shelf Ethernet cables are still of the T-568B standard; however, it 
  makes absolutely no functional difference in which you choose.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="EthernetCabling_files/ethcable568b.gif" width="400" height="250" border="0"></p>
<p>Both the T-568A and the T-568B standard Straight-Through cables are used most 
  often as patch cords for your Ethernet connections. If you require a cable to 
  connect two Ethernet devices directly together without a hub or when you connect 
  two hubs together, you will need to use a Crossover cable instead. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="EthernetCabling_files/ethcablerj45cr.gif" width="400" height="250" border="0"></p>
<p>A good way of remembering how to wire a Crossover Ethernet cable is to wire 
  one end using the T-568A standard and the other end using the T-568B standard. 
  Another way of remembering the color coding is to simply switch the Green set 
  of wires in place with the Orange set of wires. Specifically, switch the solid 
  Green (G) with the solid Orange, and switch the green/white with the orange/white.

<p><b>Ethernet Cable Instructions:</b></p><font face="Arial" size="2">
<ol>
<li>Pull the cable off the reel to the desired length and cut. If you are pulling 
  cables through holes, its easier to attach the RJ-45 plugs after the cable is 
  pulled. The total length of wire segments between a PC and a hub or between 
  two PC's cannot exceed 100 Meters (328 feet) for 100BASE-TX and 300 Meters for 
  10BASE-T.</li>
<li>Start on one end and strip the cable jacket off (about 1") using a 
  stripper or a knife. Be extra careful not to nick the wires, otherwise you will 
  need to start over. </li>
<li>Spread, untwist the pairs, and arrange the wires in the order of the desired 
  cable end. Flatten the end between your thumb and forefinger. Trim the ends 
  of the wires so they are even with one another, leaving only 1/2" in wire 
  length. If it is longer than 1/2" it will be out-of-spec and susceptible to 
  crosstalk. Flatten and insure there are no spaces between wires.</li>
<li>Hold the RJ-45 plug with the clip facing down or away from you. Push the 
  wires firmly into the plug. Inspect each wire is flat even at the front of the 
  plug. Check the order of the wires. Double check again. Check that the jacket 
  is fitted right against the stop of the plug. Carefully hold the wire and firmly 
  crimp the RJ-45 with the crimper.</li>
<li>Check the color orientation, check that the crimped connection is not about 
  to come apart, and check to see if the wires are flat against the front of the 
  plug. If even one of these are incorrect, you will have to start over. Test 
  the Ethernet cable.</li>

<p><b>Ethernet Cable Tips</b>:<font face="Arial" size="2">
<ul>
  <li><i>A straight-thru cable has identical ends.</i></li>
  <li><i>A crossover cable has different ends.</i></li>
  <li><i>A straight-thru is used as a patch cord in Ethernet connections.</i></li>
  <li><i>A crossover is used to connect two Ethernet devices without a hub or 
    for connecting two hubs.</i></li>
  <li><i>A crossover has one end with the Orange set of wires switched with the 
    Green set.</i></li>
  <li><i>Odd numbered pins are always striped, even numbered pins are always solid 
    colored. </i></li>
  <li><i>Looking at the RJ-45 with the clip facing away from you, Brown is always 
    on the right, and pin 1 is on the left.</i></li>
  <li><i>No more than 1/2" of the Ethernet cable should be untwisted otherwise 
    it will be susceptible to crosstalk.</i></li>
  <li><i>Do not deform, do not bend, do not stretch, do not staple, do not run 
    parallel with power cables, and do not run Ethernet cables near noise inducing 
    components.</i></li>

</p><p><b>Basic Theory:</b></p>

<p>By looking at a T-568A UTP Ethernet straight-thru cable and an Ethernet crossover 
  cable with a T-568B end, we see that the TX (transmitter) pins are connected 
  to the corresponding RX (receiver) pins, plus to plus and minus to minus. You 
  can also see that both the blue and brown wire pairs on pins 4, 5, 7, and 8 
  are not used in either standard. What you may not realize is that, these same 
  pins 4, 5, 7, and 8 are not used or required in 100BASE-TX as well. So why bother 
  using these wires, well for one thing its simply easier to make a connection 
  with all the wires grouped together. Otherwise you'll be spending time trying 
  to fit those tiny little wires into each of the corresponding holes in the RJ-45 
  connector.

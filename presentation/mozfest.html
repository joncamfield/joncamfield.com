				<h2>So what is SAFETAG?</h2>
				<p></p>
				<aside class="notes">
					SAFETAG is an organizational security auditing and assessment tool designed for the NGO community.
					It currently exists as an auditor guide with 12 thematic areas and over 50 specific exercises tailored for small organizations with limited technical resources, with a strong focus on agency-building and organizational change dynamics throughout the process.

					It has a corresponding curricula to train new auditors, and is available in English and Spanish, with the methods also in Arabic and Russian.

					Internews has used and adapted SAFETAG over its 3+ year life in dozens of audits ourselves, and it has been adopted in various forms by the ISC Project, Frontline Defenders, NDI, and many independent auditors as well.

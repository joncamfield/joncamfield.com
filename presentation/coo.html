						<h2>Security is Complicated</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Regardless of whether you're a local, 10-person CSO or a global iNGO, understanding risks and managing them is incredibly complex</p>
						<p class="fragment">Situations and laws change, funding is often tight, and the focus is on mission, not infrastructure.</p>

					<h2>Threats are Real</h2>
					<p class="fragment">For Human Rights Defenders, election monitors, LGBTQI Activists, Journalists, and other at-risk groups, they are a matter of life and liberty.</p>
					<p class="fragment">But security needs extend to every population - health data, participant information, biodata and salaries - NGOs work with sensitive data</p>
					<aside class="notes">
					Failure to be secure has very real consequences for targeted and vulnerable populations. A breach in privacy can mean the loss of one's job, imprisonment, or much worse. This doesn't stop with high-risk groups, though - tracking HIV or other health status information can damage reputation, livelihood, and put people at risk.  Leaked information about contracts and salary rates can target people for theft.

				<p class="fragment">Passwords: The password is the organization name plus a year or the street address</p>
				<p class="fragment">Wifi: What are you beaconing and broadcasting? Who can listen in?</p>
				<aside class="notes">Risks - giving out your password, never changing it, common office guests, nearby public spaces or other offices. Mitigations - Segmenting wireless as an insecure, guest-only network, having public and staff-only networks, updating passwords on a set schedule.
				 wifi networks are always presumed to be much more secure (or the org has a unique "more secure" method) than reality supports, though over time this appears to be getting better.

			<section data-state="blue" data-background="cooimages/Bad-Notes.png">
				<h2>"No ones uses DropBox"</h2>
				<p>Everyone's using Dropbox, and ten other cloud/web apps</p>
				<aside class="notes">Risks - Change management, insider threats, and a lack of permission management. Mitigations - working with staff to select usable options or finding ways to manage permissions through process or technology.
			    The deeper truth here is that NGOs are experts at leveraging no-cost solutions to their problems,  but this often ends up with a mixed bag of undocumented tools providing a "shadow infrastructure" that is done outside of the purview of (or hidden from) an org's technology management, or simply done in an uncoordinated fashion.  This is absolutely normal, but mapping these out often reveals the need for controls - at least at a team level, and ideally at a policy level.</aside>

				<h2>"Our systems are up to date"</h2>
				<p>Except for that Windows XP machine running legacy accounting software. Oh, and that wiki. And... </p>
				<aside class="notes">Risks - legacy software with no ongoing security support from the vendor adds significant risk over time (IoT example). Mitigation - migration where possible, and adapting workflows to isolate systems when it's not.
				Legacy technology is a huge tech debt that many organizations get trapped by, from a piece of core software that is too expensive to upgrade, too complex to migrate to one that is simply no longer supported.  This also comes in the form of websites that were built on proprietary systems or on a CMS that is so out of date that it would need re-building.  These almost always leave really large attack surfaces on core programs, and there's no easy way out - almost every "fix" will still require a highly-skilled expert to manage the transition, and funding for this type of "backoffice" work is scarce -- not to mention that it is difficult for an org to judge if the new solution will be any better, long-term.

				<h2>"None of these are big Vulnerabilities"</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
			    Hat tip to Adam Shostack; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLpgaoD8ySM .  Even small vulnerabilities are potentially disastrous once they become automated and scaled.
			    You don't have to be targeted by an APT to at risk, you just have to be on-line to be at risk</aside>

					<h2>Intergalactic Interconnections</h2>
					<p>
						You can link between slides internally,
						<a href="#/2/3">like this</a>.

				<section>
					<h2>Speaker View</h2>
					<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#speaker-notes">speaker view</a>. It includes a timer, preview of the upcoming slide as well as your speaker notes.</p>
					<p>Press the <em>S</em> key to try it out.</p>

					<h2>Export to PDF</h2>
					<p>Presentations can be <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export">exported to PDF</a>, here's an example:</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Global State</h2>
					<p>
						Set <code>data-state="something"</code> on a slide and <code>"something"</code>
						will be added as a class to the document element when the slide is open. This lets you
						apply broader style changes, like switching the page background.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section data-state="customevent">
					<h2>State Events</h2>
					<p>
						Additionally custom events can be triggered on a per slide basis by binding to the <code>data-state</code> name.
					</p>
					<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable style="font-size: 18px;">
Reveal.addEventListener( 'customevent', function() {

				<section>
					<h2>Take a Moment</h2>
					<p>
						Press B or . on your keyboard to pause the presentation. This is helpful when you're on stage and want to take distracting slides off the screen.

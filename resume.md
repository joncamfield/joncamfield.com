# Experience

## Meta (2022 - Present; Washington, DC): Product Policy / Threat Ideation

I work across Meta policy and product teams to anticipate and prevent malicious activity on Meta platforms by resourced and determined adversaries, including state-backed influence operations, surveillance-for-hire spyware vendors, and international criminal organizations. I coordinate internal cross-functional networks around adversarial design techniques, tabletop exercises, and red/blue teaming approaches to strengthen our product and policy defenses.

## Internews (2012 – 2022; Washington, DC)

I led Internews’ global portfolio of open, systems-level work countering digital authoritarianism. I built, sustained, and managed a diverse team that won over $30M in grants and designed and implemented multiple programs that created positive impact while operating safely in many of the most challenging environments, including:

* [**SAFETAG**](https://SAFETAG.org/), an open source, capacity-focused organizational security framework that supported the training of a global network of hundreds of local experts;
* [**USABLE.tools**](https://USABLE.tools/), which connected human-centered design with digital safety to change how human rights and media activists, trainers, and tool developers interact;
* [**BASICS**](https://internews.org/areas-of-expertise/global-tech/global-tech-projects/basics/), which improved the governance processes, diversity of developers, and sustainability of, open source security tool development.
* [**MONITOR**](https://internews.org/areas-of-expertise/global-tech/global-tech-projects/global-tech-monitor/), which advanced threat information sharing among the global human rights community by building the skill-sets of in-country activists to detect and taking down malicious infrastructure; 
* [**Censorship Circumvention**](https://www.pluggabletransports.info/)**:** provided \>$10M to anti-censorship tool development, community building, and standards-setting across multiple grants; and
* [**Greater Internet Freedom**](https://greaterinternetfreedom.org/) – a multi-year USAID program advancing digital rights and safety in 40 countries centering regional partners in design and execution. 

Across my work at Internews, I ensured that our on these programs work was open, responsible, sustainable, and transparent. This included creating programs closely with in-country partners, building internal organizational operational security policies and risk assessment practices, and using open source tools and open licensed content. 

I also represented Internews at the NGO-ISAC, FIRST, the Design for Democracy Steering Committee, and as a founding member of CiviCERT.

## Ashoka (2009-2012; Washington, DC): Co-Director, Tech Team, Ashoka’s Changemakers

I provided product strategy, design, and technical project management for Ashoka’s flagship Changemakers.com open competition platform  to source innovative social change ideas.

* Drove Ashoka’s approach to media, the Internet, and emerging technologies.
* Developed and led technology strategy for Changemakers’ open competitions, including mobile voting, white-label, API options, and data-driven innovation scoring.

## Youth Service America (2007-2009; Washington, DC) : ICT Director

* Directed a diverse online engagement portfolio, including social media and web strategies and launching high-visibility campaigns for the annual Global Youth Service Day and the “GetUrGoodOn” campaign with Miley Cyrus.

## CrisisLink (2005-2007; Arlington, VA): IT Manager

  * SchoolTools, a self-guided CD with free / open source software for school labs
* Provided technical and web-design support for NGOs island-wide and built an SMS-based volunteer intranet supporting volunteer emergency notifications.

**I am a technologist dedicated to advancing sustainable social change and human rights with over two decades of experience spanning the public, private, non-profit, and social enterprise sectors.**

## Internews (2012 – Present, Washington, DC)

I lead our work on innovative, systems-level interventions that respond to digital threats to human rights. Under my leadership, we build and sustain multiple programs, including:

* A multi-year, cross-grant effort providing over $10M to censorship circumvention technology development, combined with creating a neutral space for the disparate developers of anti-censorship technology to build standards and community;
* [SAFETAG](https://SAFETAG.org), an open source, capacity-focused organizational security assessment framework and global network of experts
* [USABLE](https://USABLE.tools), connecting human-centered design concepts with digital security communities to lead a sea-change in how human rights and media activists, digital security trainers, and tool developers interact;
* [MONITOR](https://internews.org/areas-of-expertise/global-tech/global-tech-projects/global-tech-monitor/), a program that advances community threat information sharing and builds the skill-sets of in-country activists to detect and, through coordination with Internews and the private sector, take down advanced malicious infrastructure; and
* [BASICS](https://internews.org/areas-of-expertise/global-tech/global-tech-projects/basics/), a project working to improve the diversity of developers in, and sustainability of, open source security tool development.

In parallel with these program outputs, I have ensured that our work is sustainable, transparent, and in the open, prioritizing open source tools, building content under Creative Commons licenses, and supporting the capacity of and learning from local actors. To enable this work, I have sustained and managed a diverse team and led proposals winning over $30M in funding since 2015.
